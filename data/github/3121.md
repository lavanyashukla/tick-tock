TITLE:
[App] Bug: Issue when using subheadings with the same name

LABEL:
stale,app

STATE:
open

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
The heading is represented using the anchor "#$headingName" in the reports. This creates issues when there are multiple headers with the same name. Consider the use case:
```
# Model 1
## Train
## Validation

# Model 2
## Train
## Validation
```
Model1/Train and Model2/Train sections are represented using the anchor #train, which is wrong because it's not unique. Hence, sharing or scrolling to the section Model2/Train points to the section Model1/Train.


**Expected behavior**
In the table of content, clicking on a subheading should scroll the page to it. Each subheading should have a unique anchor.



**To Reproduce**
See [this](https://wandb.ai/andreimargeloiu/low-data/reports/Bug-section--VmlldzoxNDE0NjE0?accessToken=a2trl5l58qidjznqfmifgwv7fd1wvxai9yq2mvz0k2y2sjdud2lb28cqxy5yuopj#subsection-a) example report.

Notice that clicking on any "Subsection A" updates the URL with the anchor "#subsection-a," which is wrong because it scrolls down only to the first "Subsection A".
