Support lists in config UI

### Description

In the wandb web app, the overview page of a wandb run shows logged config fields. These commonly include hyperparameters such as learning rate or number of hidden layers. While the structure of config values is typically key-value pairs, it sometimes makes sense to use a list when the number of entries is variable, for example when a list of validation datasets may be provided to the run configuration.

The UI currently displays lists as a flattened text field, as the following example shows. This makes them harder to read. It would be great to support display of lists (and nested lists/dictionaries inside of them).
