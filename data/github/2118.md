**Description**
The sklearn integration function `plot_feature_importances` fails when using a `feature_importances` attribute of `np.array` type. e.g.

```python
# works
two_features = ['f1', 'f2']
plot_feature_importances(model, feature_names=two_features)

# fails
two_features = np.array(["a", "b"])
plot_feature_importances(model, feature_names=two_features)
```

**Wandb features**
Using `plot_feature_importances` from the sklearn integration.
