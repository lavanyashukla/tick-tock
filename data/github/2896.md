TITLE:
[App] Expressions not working

LABEL:
app

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
Whenever I want to use an expression in any panel I get ```Oops, something went wrong. If this keeps happening, message support@wandb.com with a link to this page```. I tried to add an expression for multiple panel types and in two different projects on different browsers (firefox/chromium/chrome).
This message is shown as soon as I type the closing bracket '}'. Afterward, all options to set up the panel disappear, and the only options 'OK', 'Cancel', and 'Delete' are shown.

**EDIT:** The console outputs the following:
```
ReferenceError: Buffer is not defined
    qX expr.ts:466
    qX expr.ts:463
    Xh expr.ts:527

(I have sent an EMail to support@wandb.com as well)

3. Change to tab ```Expressions```
4. Click on ```Add an expression```
5. Type in ```${Step}``` (or choose any of the available metrics)
6. See the error as soon as you type ```}```

**Expected behavior**
A line plot should appear containing the Step variable
