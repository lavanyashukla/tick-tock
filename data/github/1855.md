BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
It seems there's no way to only delete the media files in each run after it finishes. The media usually consumes the largest storage yet the least useful. So is there any way to just delete all images uploaded to the run?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A way to delete all images or media uploaded.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None.

**Additional context**
None.
