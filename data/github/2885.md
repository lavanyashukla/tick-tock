TITLE:
None for X axis (to plot only available data)

Hi,

I wanted to plot the available data without anything to x-axis (x-axis is only an increment like np.arange(len(available_data)) ). But I could not find a way to do this.

My specific use case is, I am running an RL agent on a time series task and it trains for a year and then predict for a year. Then it trains again and predicts for the next year and so on. But when I try to plot the prediction parameters, it has a few million steps in-between with no data, but in the plot, since we have to use step, the real plot is not really showing.

Therefore, it would be great if we can have an option for x-axis just to have an increment value.
