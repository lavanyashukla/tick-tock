TITLE:
[CLI] Slow uploads of offline runs

LABEL:

BODY:
Since 16th March 2021, I have been having this issue of slow upload speeds for `wandb sync my_wand_folder` for the offline runs (takes around 2 hours for a 100 MB file) even if the internet speed is good enough for other stuff. I am not sure if this is a bug from the wandb side or if there is something wrong on my end.

**Environment**
- OS: Mac OS Mojave 10.14 (the one from where I am uploading the logs)
- Python Version: 3.6.10
- Wandb Version: 0.10.12
