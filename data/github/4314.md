TITLE:
[Q] Can I run a wandb sweep while using model parallelism?

BODY:
Hi, I am using model parallelism with deepspeed and huggingface Trainer.
I want to do hyperparameter tuning using wandb sweep.
Model parallism must be done because of the large size of the model.
I ran into the following issues.

What should I do? I'd appreciate it if you could let me know.

huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used. Disabling parallelism to avoid deadlocks...
To disable this warning, you can either:
        - Avoid using `tokenizers` before the fork if possible
        - Explicitly set the environment variable TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=(true | false)
