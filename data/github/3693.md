[Feature]: Zoom in/out charts

### Description

I wonder if charts can be zoomed in and out like in Tensorboard by holding alt and then scrolling?
Sometimes I don't want the whole chart is fullfilled by those curves and zooming out a bit makes it more good looking.


### Suggested Solution

If this function is missing, I'm looking forward to seeing it in the feature.
