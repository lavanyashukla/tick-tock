[Q] The metric graph in Sweep not rendering correctly

Hi.

In the Sweep Workspace where summary plots are shown, I see a graph titled `my_metric v. created` which is supposed to show the obtained metric values from all runs against the time the results were created. However, as you can see from the screenshot below, I can only see a single point (when there are more than 100 finished runs).

Besides, the limits of the time created axis are pretty weird.

Furthermore, in the part where multiple lines with different configurations should be plotted, I can only see a single line whose configuration seems to be sort of an average of all runs (see below).

When I click a specific run, I can see the correct results uploaded to the server. 

Please let me know what's going wrong here. 

Thanks,
Jihwan
