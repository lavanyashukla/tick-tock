[Q] How to update wandb.plot.histogram iteratively?

Hello Everyone,

I'm looking to update wandb.plot.histogram() for every k steps during training. It seems every time I can wandb.log() on the table, it just overwrites previous steps. I was wondering if there's a way to append the existing histogram other than saving previous steps locally.

Thanks in advance!
