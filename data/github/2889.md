**Description**
Wandb fails to load sdk.lib

**Wandb features**
Version: 0.7 - 0.12.6 all yield same problem
Code: import wandb

Error:
ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)

**How to reproduce**
I am not sure how to reproduce this to be honest. It just happens on a fresh import

After deleting the package in the environment and reinstalling the latest version, I did confirm wandb/sdk/lib is a directory in the installed source code. All other code and packages run as desired.

That being said, I have a separate program using wandb in a separate directory in a large server system, but using the same config and account, and that program runs fine. After running that program, this is when the issue started.

Edit: I've verified that "import wandb" works using Python 3.6 from the command line and it is only via running on jupyter notebook (v6.2.0) that this problem occurs

**Environment**
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
- Environment: Conda
- Python Version:  3.6

Is this a common bug? This happens when reloading everything from scratch on a fresh build.
