TITLE:
Group by run name doesn't handle run name updates

Hi, 

Sorry I don't have an example for this but it should be easy to verify. This is what I did:
- Run some experiments, create a custom line plot (not sure if that matters) and group by run name
- Change some of the run names via the API
- Refresh the page to update the plot

After I change the run names I can't get the plot to group by the new names. It still has some of the old names being used instead. I waited overnight hoping it might just take some time, tried turning on and off the grouping, tried re-creating the plot from scratch (which would be a huge pain but was worth trying) but I can't get it to correctly display the new names.

Thanks in advance for your help on this!
