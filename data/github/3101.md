TITLE:
[App] Bug: Parallel plot maintains old selections after being added to reports

**Describe the bug**
Adding parallel plots from sweeps to reports shows the following bug: the plot keeps showing the runs selected to be visualized at the time the plot was added to the report.

In the report, even when no run in selected to be visualized, the plot still shows runs (the ones visualized when the plot was added to the report).

I created a simple [report](https://wandb.ai/andreimargeloiu/low-data/reports/Bug-panels-in-reports--VmlldzoxNDAxOTYy/edit) showing this issue. The following three screenshots illustrate the bug:

Case 1: Plot added when NO runs are visualized -> it works as expected (I'm able to show/hide some runs)

Case 2: Plot added when SOME runs were visualized -> the selected runs are visualized even when no run is select

Case 3: Plot added when ALL runs were visualized -> ALL runs are visualized even when no run is select

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a sweep.
2. Visualize all runs in the parallel plot.
3. Add plot to a report.
4. Now visualize no runs in the parallel plot.
5. Add the new plot to the same report.
6. Now visualize some runs in the parallel plot.
7. Add the new plot to the same report.

**Expected behavior**
I would expect to manipulate the plots and make them identical if wanted. I expect no run to be selected in the plot when I deselect all runs (this happens only in case 1 above).
