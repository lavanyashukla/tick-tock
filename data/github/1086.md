TITLE:
wandb.log() should fail silently if not logged in

LABEL:
enhancement

STATE:
closed

BODY:
The code should still function if not logged in (no `WANDB_API_KEY` or `wandb login`) is set. Currently it throws an error if you attempt to log.

Related to https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/764; I would like to distribute my code to users who do not have wandb enabled.
