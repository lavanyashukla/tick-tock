[Q] modify data plotted on charts

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I have a simulation in which some data are collected during the run:
`wandb.log({'x': x[i],
                           'y': y[i]}) `
In the above example during the run some measures `x[i]` and `y[i]` are computed and for each `i` logged into wandb.
After the run ended I enter into wandb dashboard and I'd like to visualize the chart customizing the axis; for example I want to rescale the data, i.e. visualize, instead of **x** vs **y**, **x/R** vs **y**, where **x** and **y** are the logged data from the simulation and **R** is a generic constant.
I'm aware that **during** the logging stage (during the run) is it possible to specify many possible choises for the x axis but here I want to modify one of them **after** the simulation ends (because for example I don't know the value of **R** and I have to infere it from different data returned from the same simulation).
How can this be done?
