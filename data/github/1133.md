### Description

Hi there! From the documentation, I find that default metrics will be averaged every 30 seconds. I want to ask if we have any approach to change the time interval. I hope that users can have the option to choose by themselves. For example, if I have a program that runs for about 3 minutes, we might want to record system metrics every 5 or 10 seconds. If not, is there any way to add some code to make a control outside of `wandb` package. Thank you!
