TITLE:
[CLI]: Agent ends without killing script on Slurm.

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
### Describe the bug

When running sweeps on Slurm, the agent occasionally ends without ending the underlying python script. This results in a cascade of crashes as Slurm launches jobs on nodes where resources are not available. The script itself continues logging successfully.

The associated Slurm files contain a series of 429 and Network Errors, but no traceback.

### Additional Files

_No response_

### Environment

WandB version: 0.12.14

OS: Ubuntu 20.04

Python version: 3.7.12

Versions of relevant libraries:
Slurm: 0.4.3
Munge: 0.5.13

### Additional Context

We typically run our agents with --count 1. The problem does not appear on shorter (i.e., < 1 hour) jobs.
