### Description

I am trying to log a histogram into wandb. The run appears on wandb, but the histogram is not there.
Other stuff such as scalars or Images is logged properly. What is wrong?


### What I Did
`
import wandb
import numpy as np

wandb.init(entity="MyEntity", project="my project", name="testing")
a = np.random.randn(100)
hist = np.histogram(a)
h = wandb.Histogram(np_histogram=hist)
wandb.log({"gradients": wandb.Histogram(np_histogram=hist)})
`
