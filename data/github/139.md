TITLE:
wandb executable should work with pyenv

LABEL:

BODY:
Right now if wandb is used with pyenv it's easy to end up with different versions and cryptic, hard to debug errors.

Jupyter notebook respects the pyenv version if you've installed it by somehow putting an executable link in: ~/.pyenv/shims/jupyter - maybe we should do this?  At the very least, we should warn if the library version is different from the executable version.
