TITLE:
wandb.config is None sometimes

LABEL:
bug,stale,multiprocessing

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I'm launching 16 processes on 2 machines through mpirun and `wandb.config` is None for 14 of these processes which crashes `wandb.config ... = ...` lines

I got around this crash by adding checks like below
```
if wandb.confg is not None:
  wandb.config['key'] = ...
```
Surprisingly that worked, so I'm confused why `wandb.config` would be `None` but leave the rest of the logging infrastructure functional.

Here are all 16 runs -- https://app.wandb.ai/yaroslavvb/imagenet18/groups/enable_efa_spawn-i9d

Not sure if related, but this co-occurred with me changing the launching mode of additional data crunching processes to [spawn](https://github.com/cybertronai/imagenet18_/blob/6a423eb57a90a9c9c19d0043fb07f3120f0d7e6f/training/dataloader.py#L41)
