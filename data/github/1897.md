TITLE:
[CLI] Synchronyzing artifact dataset with amazon S3 sometime fails

LABEL:
c:artifacts,cli,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
We are using W&B artifact as dataset of links to S3 real data.
However, sometime doing the following command fails to update artifact with links to S3

wandb init -e XXX -p YYY
 wandb artifact put -n YYY -t dataset  s3://bucketyname/YYY

I see that dataset artifact is cretaed correctly but its links are missing
