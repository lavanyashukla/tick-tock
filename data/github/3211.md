TITLE:
[Feature] Allow legend reordering

**Context**
I'm creating a line plot with multiple similar metrics inside a run. The metrics I'm plotting differ only by some hyperparameters. It's a bit annoying that I cannot change the order of the Y lines after being added.

It would be great to allow changing the legend order by drag-and-drop. In my case, I would like to order them after some hyper-parameters, so the legend is easy to read.
