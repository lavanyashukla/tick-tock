TITLE:
[App] Unexpected value of custom step x-axis when visualising a plot from the groups

LABEL:

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
When visualising a plot from the groups , there is an error with the value of the custom step when going with the cursor over the line. The problem does not appear when visualising a plot directly from a run.

**Expected behavior**
The value of the custom step should correspond to what has been logged.

**Screenshots**

Here is a plot visualisation from the groups (the step shown should be 30000 and not 33912.652)
