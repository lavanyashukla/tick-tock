### Description

I try to log my custom losses using tensorboard. It seems wandb isn't compatible with the @tf.function decorator, and it would mean that using wandb would slow down the code considerably. Is tf.function supported ? 

### What I Did

```
@tf.function
def train_on_batch(self, obs1, obs2, act, rew, done, step):
[...]
   wandb.tensorflow.log('losses/q1_loss', q1_loss, step=step)
```
Error: TypeError: To be compatible with tf.contrib.eager.defun, Python functions must return zero or more Tensors; in compilation of <function create_converted_entity_factory.<locals>.create_converted_entity.<locals>.tf__log.<locals>.<lambda> at 0x000001D386C6B288>, found return value of type <class 'wandb.history.History'>, which is not a Tensor.
