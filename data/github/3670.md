TITLE:
[Q] [docs] What's the difference b/w `wandb.log_artifact(*, name='foo')` and `wandb.Artifact('foo')`?

BODY:
According to https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts#quickly-log-your-first-artifact, it's possible to set the `Artifact` `name` in a `log_artifact` call. But according to https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts#log-a-new-version, this can also be done with `wandb.Artifact('foo')`. (Same goes for `type`.)

What is the difference between these two? Why are there two seemingly equivalent ways to accomplish the same thing?
