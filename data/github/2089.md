TITLE:
[Q] How to track a hard-coded config?

LABEL:
question

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Sometimes there are so many configuration options and I know an option would always be set to the same value after comparison. I don't want to complicate the global configuration parser anymore. So I prefer to copy the code and hard code the option in different copies. Such an option still needs to be tracked for comparison. What's the easiest way to do this? Is there anything like a wrapper which I can add to the hard-coded option line and track it?
