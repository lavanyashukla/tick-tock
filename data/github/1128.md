TITLE:
Images: logging an image that is already saved to the wandb directory doesn't resize properly

### Description

I'm logging png images to wandb run with wandb.log(). The overall process seems to go fine, but only a part of each image is displayed in web-interface (Media charts): they seem to have been cropped to a square size somewhere on the way.
Is there a way to view whole images?

### What I Did

```
wandb.log({'image': wb.Image('predicted.png')}, step=log_step)
```
