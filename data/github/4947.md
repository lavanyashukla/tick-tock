TITLE:
[App]: Panel drag-and-drop involuntarily scrolls to top on Firefox

STATE:

### Current Behavior

When I try to drag and drop to reorder panels on Firefox, as soon as the drag motion starts, the page is scrolled upward with every mousemovent (lateral, upward and downward). This makes reordering panels impossible -- unless you happen to want to drag all panels to the top row :-) In Chrome the behavior is normal.

### Expected Behavior

When dragging a panel, the panel should move across the visible part of the page, and only when the mouse hits a border, the page should scroll in that direction.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. In Firefox, open a run with enough panels that tha page can be scrolled down
2. Scroll down
3. Pick a panel and try to drag it sideways

The page will scroll up as soon as the dragging movement starts in any direction.
