TITLE:
[Feature]: Sweep name in the web display

### Description

I am not sure if this is a bug or a feature request.  Right now if I have a named sweep it does not display in the UI.  See below:

Only the sweepid shows, but it would be great if it could show both the id and the name.  

What makes this especially odd is that there is a `rename sweep` option after selecting a sweep, even though you can't actually see the name.  That makes me wonder if I am seeing a bug.


### Suggested Solution

Display both in that UI, or maybe allow it to choose columns.  More generally it would be great to get other sorts of columns there (e.g., the `method`, etc.)
