Conda-installed CLI 0.10.12 throwing TypeError: 'module' object is not callable

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
wandb cli is throwing `TypeError: 'module' object is not callable` when running `wandb login` and `wandb sweep sweepfile.yaml`

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Setup Conda environment with python 3.9.1, on Ubuntu 18.04. Install wandb 0.10.12 via conda
2. Run `wandb login` from within the conda environment

**Expected behavior**
CLI wandb should be callable.

**Screenshots**
I got the error below:
```
➜ wanbd login   
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/XX/miniconda3/envs/XXX/bin/wanbd", line 10, in <module>
    sys.exit(cli())
TypeError: 'module' object is not callable
```

**Operating System**
 - OS: Ubuntu 18.04
 - Version 0.10.12

Info on the conda release:
```
➜ conda list wan
# packages in environment at /home/XX/miniconda3/envs/XXX:
#
# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
wandb                     0.10.12            pyhd3deb0d_0    conda-forge
```

**Additional info**:
This seems to occur only with the Conda build, which is from here https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/wandb
The pip version works as expected.
