[Feature] Sweep config: Specify parameter combinations as categorical

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Imagine a setting where you want to train a fully connected network but you have some space constraints - simplifying let's say you only want to train networks within some particular range of total number of hidden units (`hidden_units_min <= hidden_units <= hidden_units_max`).
`hidden_units` depends on `num_layers` and `layer_size`, `hidden_units = num_layers * layer_size`.
Naively we could run a sweep in a standard way, sweeping over all possibly combinations, but it’s very wasteful and slow because obviously `wandb` sweep doesn’t know about the relationship between `hidden_units`, `num_layers`, `layer_size`, and the `loss` which is a sum of performance metric (the lower the better) and a penalty on `hidden_units` deviating from the target hidden units range.
```
method: bayes
metric:
  goal: minimize
  name: loss  # loss = performance + penalty on hidden_units deviating from the target hidden_units range
parameters:
  num_layers:
    max: 4
    min: 1
    distribution: int_uniform
  layer_size:
    max: 128
    min: 8
    distribution: int_uniform
  ...
```
One way to address this problem is to “preprocess” the `sweep.yaml` and provide plausible combinations of pairs of `(num_layers, layer_size)` that satisfy your condition (which you can do because of your prior knowledge), which I'd imagine could yield a `sweep.yaml` along these lines (pending yaml syntax?)
```
parameters:
  "num_layers,layer_size":  # needs "..." to be interpreted as a string?
    values:
      - [1, 128]
      - [2, 64]
      - [3, 43]
      - [4, 32]
    distribution: categorical
  ...
```

**Describe the solution you’d like**
I would like to be able to specify `sweep.yaml` as per the suggestion above.

**Describe alternatives you’ve considered**
I have a hacky workaround: a new argument which takes a string, splits it by `,`, casts values to `int` and overwrites the other arguments `num_layers` and `layer_size`:
```
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("-lss", "--layer_size", help="Layer size", type=int, default=32)
parser.add_argument("-nl", "--num_layers", help="Number of layers", type=int, default=4)
parser.add_argument("-nllsss", "--num_layers_layer_size_sweep", help="For plausible architecture sweep purpose",
                    type=str, default=None)
args = parser.parse_args()

if args.num_layers_layer_size_sweep is not None:
    args.num_layers, args.layer_size = (int(i) for i in args.num_layers_layer_size_sweep.split(','))

wandb.init(config=args, ...)
```
and in `sweep.yaml`
```
parameters:
  num_layers_layer_size_sweep:
    values:
      - "4,32"
      - "3,48"
    distribution: categorical
  ...
```
