### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
Hi I am having troubles syncing with the cloud using wandb, the script gets stuck uploading very small data (0.005MB) to the cloud for no reason.
When I stop the code using Control+C it says "Run data was not synced" even though I can still see the metric I logged in the cloud.
I'll show a minimal example where this happens.
<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
import wandb


def main():
    for i in range(100):
        wandb.log({"loss": i})


if __name__ == "__main__":
    wandb.init(project="VTI-DA", entity="yasser96")
    wandb.require("service")
    main()
    wandb.finish()
```

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
(asm_flow) yasser@saturn:~/asm_flow$ python wand_test.py
wandb: Currently logged in as: yasser96. Use `wandb login --relogin` to force relogin
wandb: Tracking run with wandb version 0.13.1
wandb: Run data is saved locally in /home/yasser/asm_flow/wandb/run-20220905_100231-2lqn06ah
wandb: Run `wandb offline` to turn off syncing.

wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish... (success).
wandb: \ 0.000 MB of 0.005 MB uploaded (0.000MB deduped) 
```
It gets stuck indefinitely at this point, when typing Control+C I get this:
```shell

wandb: Tracking run with wandb version 0.13.1
