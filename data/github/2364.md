TITLE:
[Q] Turn off wandb logging for part of the code

LABEL:

BODY:
I'm using wandb with inbuilt tensorboard sync i.e. `wandb.init(project='project_name', sync_tensorboard=True)`. Is there a way to stop wandb from logging a specific `writer.add_...` while logging others? 

For example, I have some `writer.add_scalar` and `writer.add_image` (for writing scalars like losses, metrics, etc. and visualizing images respectively). Since images take up a lot of memory and they would already be written to my local memory (since tensorboard), I want to avoid those getting logged in wandb. Is there some context manager type solution available (`with wandb.temporary_turn_off: .....`) or something else?

I suppose one solution would be to use the actual wandb commands instead of tensorboard but is there any other simpler solution?
