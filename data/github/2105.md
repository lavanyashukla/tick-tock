TITLE:
[CLI] Duplicate entry [...] for key 'PRIMARY' (<Response [409]>)

**Description**
I'm running a workflow that requires resuming of runs (evaluating different metrics some time after the initial training is over). Until yesterday, this worked like a charm using
```python
wandb.init(project='...', id='<run_id>', resume=True)
```
However, this has stopped working today for some reason. The error message I am getting is:
```
ERROR Error while calling W&B API: Error 1062: Duplicate entry '261819-6f6c567v' for key 'PRIMARY' (<Response [409]>)
```

So it looks to me like some server side code has changed regarding the resuming of previous runs.
Updating my client library to the latest version did not fix the problem.

**Wandb features**
Essentially just `wandb.init()`, although the error message only pops up after a while (presumably due to asynchronous stuff).

**How to reproduce**
The minimal code for reproducing this error is given here: https://gist.github.com/khdlr/887f4e81a17388fe85f7751338d51247
Running `python test_01.py` and then `python test_02.py` will consistently reproduce this error for me across machines.
