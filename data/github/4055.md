[Q] TensorBoard data does not upload to WandB properly after upgrading from 0.12.20 to 0.13.0

Hi,

Thank you again for developing the amazing tools!

I am using WandB along with tensorboard. Moreover, I am doing training and evaluation in a multiprocessing manner. Thus, I call `wandb.init` in all my processes and use the group keyword argument to define a shared group as suggested in the documentation.

Recently, I upgraded my WandB from 0.12.20 to 0.13.0. However, only the main-process results are logged in my wandb workspace. For the evaluation results that are done by a remote worker (in a different process), they do not show in the workspace. However, I can still access its `Tensorboard` information on the wandb webpage. This issue does not happen to version 0.12.20.

Could help me have a look on this? Happy to provide more details if needed!

Thanks,
Jiachen
