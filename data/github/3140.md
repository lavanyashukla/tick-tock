TITLE:
[CLI] Artifacts keep re-downloading even though they had already been downloaded

LABEL:

**Description**
Not sure if this is the intended behavior, but every time I try to use an artifact that is already downloaded in the artifacts directory wandb tries to download it again. So it basically downloads over and over again a bunch of files to `.cache/wandb/artifacts `, which is increasing in size all the time.

**Wandb features**
Use artifacts (already logged in) in a loop:
```
versions = ["v0", "v1", "v2"]
datasets = []
with wandb.init(project="my-project", job_type="train") as run:
        config = wandb.config

        for version in versions:
                data = run.use_artifact(f"dataset:{version}")
                data_dir = data.download()

                training_dataset =  read(data_dir, "train")
                validation_dataset = read(data_dir, "val")

                datasets.append((training_dataset.dataset[:10], validation_dataset.dataset[:10]))
```

**How to reproduce**
1. Upload artifacts to wandb app.
2. Use artifacts. As far as I know, `data.download()` should only download the artifacts in case they are not in the artifacts directory.
3. `.cache/wandb/artifacts` grows.

**Environment**
- OS:  Ubuntu 20.04.3
- Environment: local jupyter notebook
- Python Version: 3.8.5
- wandb version: 0.12.9
