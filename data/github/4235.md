Wandb fails when run on a server

Hi, I've been using Wandb locally for awhile now using pytorch-lighthing, and it has all worked well. I have just moved my code to a cluster, and now I'm having an issue with the url that wandb is trying to access:
Instead of calling : https://api.wandb.ai/graphql  it's trying to call {proxy_url}/graphql


  File "versions/slot_att_local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/vendor/gql-0.2.0/wandb_gql/client.py", line 60, in _get_result
    return self.transport.execute(document, *args, **kwargs)
  File ".pyenv/versions/slot_att_local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/vendor/gql-0.2.0/wandb_gql/transport/requests.py", line 39, in execute
    request.raise_for_status()
  File "/.pyenv/versions/slot_att_local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/requests/models.py", line 1021, in raise_for_status
    raise HTTPError(http_error_msg, response=self)
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: http://hpc-proxy00.city.ac.uk:3128/graphql

Do you have any ideas what I'm doing wrong or what I should change ?
