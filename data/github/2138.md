[Q] Multiple scalars same plot

Hi guys,

I have a dictionary with multiple scalars computed every epoch `rewards = {'x': 0.1, 'y': 0.4, 'z': 0.5, ...}`, I'd like to log all of them in the same figure as a "multiple" line plot.

Do you have any suggestion? I tried with `wandb.plot.line_series`, but I didn't manage to achieve a behaviour similar to tensorboard's `SummaryWriter.add_scalar('Rewards', rewards (dict above), epoch (int))`.

Thank you in advance!
