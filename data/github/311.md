### Description

In Jupyter Lab, I have a training loop, and it is preceeded by the magic function %%wandb

import wandb
wandb.init()

%%wandb
def train_model(params):
....
```

> UsageError:  Line magic function `%%wandb` not found.

What is needed to display live results while training?  And why is %%wandb not found even though wandb is installed and imported
