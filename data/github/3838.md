[Q] Is it possible to disable ssl check on wandb.init()?

LABEL:

BODY:
When trying to do `wandb.init(...)` inside our corp ML platform, I get this error - `ssl.SSLError: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:852)` 

The error is expected because of how the platform is set up and I have no control over it. I'm wondering if it is possible to disable this check?  In my usecase I'm ok with reduced security for the sake of simpler usage.

Thanks.
