[Feature] Public sharing of datasets with DOI

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I work with wandb artifacts to manage my data for some time now. I highly appreciate efficient work with large datasets (x10Gbs), API access, versioning support, multiple artifacts per project, connection to my ML experiments, and the online interface for browsing files. 

Now that my work is coming to the publication stage, I realize that wandb could be an ideal place to share my data publically thanks to the above features, as an alternative to Kaggle, figshare, Harvard Dataverse, etc.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
To use wandb as a dataset sharing tool, I'd like to have the following additional features:
* Assigning DOI to projects \ artifacts
* Upgraded project summary page with extended description note (kind of readme), the list of artifacts, and reports in the project (which could serve as place for extensive descriptions and documentation). Current projects open the run dashboard as a default start page, which might not be suitable if the primary project purpose is dataset sharing.

The latter might be substituted with an already existing report features, but I'm not experienced with reports, so I'm not sure ðŸ¤”
