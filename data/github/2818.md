[Feature] Diff view for dataset artifact

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When uploading a datset, I understand that the wandb system already checks for the difference in files, and therefore only stores the files that have changed. I notice that in the UI, there's no way to check what changed between veresions. Instead, there's a "Notes" tab for each version which has "What changed in this revision?" in the text box. 

Code I'm using to upload dataset: 
```
dataset = wandb.Artifact(..., type='dataset')
dataset.add_dir(vid_dir)
wandb.log_artifact(dataset)
```

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be nice if each new version listed the diff view, so we can see at a glance what's changed between dataset versions, instead of having to note it down ourselves 

This is especially useful if the new verison is simply adding more data, or something of the sort. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
An alternative is to write it in the "Notes" section ourselves, but as implied above, this is a bit tedious and a bit time consuming 

**Additional context**
Thank you for reading my request! Looking forward to what you think of it.
