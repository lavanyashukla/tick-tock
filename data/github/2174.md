TITLE:
Is it possible to transfer a run from one project to another (including all artifacts)?

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I realized that I had initialized my run to the wrong project after it had trained for 3 hours. 
I was wondering if I could simply transfer the run from one project to another instead of having to retrain the whole model again with the correct project name. I also saved the model to the artifacts and would also like to place this in the artifacts of the corresponding project.

Is this possible?
