TITLE:
[Q] How to configure log-uniform sweep parameter with 0 as an option

LABEL:
c:sweeps

STATE:
open

BODY:
I have a number of regularization parameters in sweeps that I run that I would like to sample from a log-uniform distribution, but also include 0 as a possible value. For example, see Appendix B of "Tabular Data: Deep Learning is not All You Need" at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.03253.pdf that shows some parameters that the authors sample like this.

I've tried configuring the sweep parameters with `distribution: log_uniform_values` and `min: 0` but the wandb sweeps command returns a 400 error when I try to set this up.

Is there any way to configure a sweep parameter like this?
