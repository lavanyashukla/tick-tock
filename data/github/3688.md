TITLE:
[Feature]: Discord Webhook Alert

LABEL:
feature_request,c:core

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Description

An alert mechanism for Discord, just like Slack.

### Suggested Solution

I'm currently using something like this to send webhook alerts to Discord that behaves similar to the Slack alert.
Would be great if there was native integration in WandB for this.

```py
import json
import requests

from wandb.sdk.wandb_run import Run

# You have to use Decimal numeral system, not Hexadecimal.
# Use https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/ and https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hex-to-decimal-converter
DISCORD_GREEN = 6075785
DISCORD_RED = 9770003


def discord_alert(webhook_url: str, run: Run, state="finished"):
    if state == "finished":
        color = DISCORD_GREEN
        description = "Your Weights & Biases run just finished. Yay!"
        title = f"Triggered: Run finished ({run.name})"
    elif state == "crashed":
        color = DISCORD_RED
        description = "Your Weights & Biases run just failed. Go check it out."
        title = f"Triggered: Run failed ({run.name})"

    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    payload = json.dumps({
        "username": "W&B Alerts",
        "avatar_url": "https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2019-03-01/565107977331_b7799dfcbcd352259517_512.png",
        "embeds": [
            {
                "title": title,
                "description": description,
                "url": f"{'' if run is None else run.get_url()}",
                "color": color,
                "fields": [
                    {
                        "name": "User",
                        "value": run.entity,
                        "inline": True,
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "State",
                        "value": state,
                        "inline": True,
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    })
    return requests.post(url=webhook_url, data=payload, headers=headers)
```

### Alternatives

_No response_

### Additional Context

Happy to contribute, just need pointers on where this would live.
It looks it might involve internal W&B changes though.

This is how the above webhook looks btw
