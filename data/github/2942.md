[Q] How to batch-add/edit tags to runs?

BODY:
Hi, as I realized an issue with my training pipeline after performing many runs, but would like to keep these runs, I need a way to add a tag such as "Bug" to ~800 runs so they can easily be filtered in the UI. 

Is there a way to do this with the API instead of by-hand?
