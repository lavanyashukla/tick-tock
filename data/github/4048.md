WandB naming issue

Hello, around 1am EST I started encountering an issue in all of my runs (using google colab).  All of the run names are being assigned the project name.  The crashed jobs were just jobs I aborted after I noticed this happening.  This is happening across all code pieces and across all projects.  The exact same code was fine just before this happened and now all W&B jobs have this issue, do you have any advice?  Thank you!
