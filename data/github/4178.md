TITLE:
[Feature]: Reinitialize Sweep in Webapp in case of failed specification

LABEL:

### Description

It happens quite often to me that I configure a sweep, forgetting a variable to be set or misspecifying something. When I then start the sweep, the first run obviously fails, making it impossible to edit the sweep configuration.

As a result, I have to create a new sweep, copy-pasting the entire sweep configuration, followed by entering the new sweep agent command into my cluster. This can be quite annoying.

### Suggested Solution

It would be nice to have some sort of option to reset a sweep, deleting previous runs and allowing to edit the sweep configuration again. For someone like me who performs a lot of smaller sweeps in different experiments, this would save a lot of time.
