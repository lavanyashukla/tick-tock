I would like to do two different training runs in a script. When I do that currently, it get the error  `wandb.wandb_config.ConfigError: Attempted to change value of key "experiment_name" from test_01 to test_02`. I've looked into the code and online API, but I could not find anything about terminating/re-instantiating the logger. Is that possible?
