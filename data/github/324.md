Windows separate drives execution issue

BODY:

* Python version: 3.7.0
* Operating System: Windows 10

### Description
My main working directory in a directory that is not the C: drive but a different drive, specifically the D: drive.

### What I Did
Running from the command line and wandb execution eg:
```
wandb login
or
wandb --help
or
wandb --version

I get the error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python37\Lib\runpy.py", line 193, in _run_module_as_main
    "__main__", mod_spec)
  File "C:\Python37\Lib\runpy.py", line 85, in _run_code
    exec(code, run_globals)
  File "D:\workspace\.virtualenvs\conx\Scripts\wandb.exe\__main__.py", line 5, in <module>
  File "d:\workspace\.virtualenvs\conx\lib\site-packages\wandb\__init__.py", line 66, in <module>
    GLOBAL_LOG_FNAME = os.path.relpath(GLOBAL_LOG_FNAME, os.getcwd())
  File "d:\workspace\.virtualenvs\conx\lib\ntpath.py", line 564, in relpath
    path_drive, start_drive))
ValueError: path is on mount 'C:', start on mount 'D:'
```

Looks like it's looking for a relative path on two different drives. 

A quick work around I did was to comment the line 66 in `wandb.__init\\__.py`
`GLOBAL_LOG_FNAME = os.path.relpath(GLOBAL_LOG_FNAME, os.getcwd())`
