TITLE:
[Q] Is there any `direct_url` to existing artifact files?

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
As of the File System, we can easily retrieve the `direct_url` of a file uploaded to a `wandb` run, pointing to the Google Storage URL as follows:

```python
import wandb
api = wandb.Api()
file = api.run(f"{entity}/{project}/{run_id}").file(name=file_path)
file.direct_url
```

Is there any way to actually retrieve the URL to the Google Storage for the Artifact Store files? If not, can it be implemented?

```python
import wandb
api = wandb.Api()
artifact = api.artifact(name=f"{entity}/{project}/{artifact_name}:{artifact_version}", type=artifact_type)
file = artifact.get_path(name=file_path)
file.direct_url
```

Thanks in advance! :D
