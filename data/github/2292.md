Hello all,

I have a question about the *.wand file in the local .wandb folder. In my opinion, it is way too big for what it should be? It is ~ 6GB, for only one experiment/run.

I log some statistics every 10th iteration, including the gradients. Are the gradients the reasons that my log file is so extremely big (the models I use are also not that complex)? I know this depends completely on your experiment setting(s) (how long you train and what you log etc.). But what should I do to keep this file of reasonable size?

Thanks!

Maurits
