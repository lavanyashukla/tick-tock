How to run sweeps with python module?

BODY:
I am trying to use sweeps to search for the best hyperparameters, but I encountered the problem that I can't run the python module with sweeps config like this.

`python -m models.model_name.main`

I have tried changed `program` in config into `-m models.model_name.main`
`program: -m models.DeepAverageNetwork.main`
, but it turns out to run `python "-m models.model_name.main"`  and thus fails.

I would like to know if there's a way to run python module for sweeps?
