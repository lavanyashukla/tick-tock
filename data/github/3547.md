TITLE:
 [App]: Unable to create custom chart using summary key that doesn't exist for all runs

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

Including a summary key in the query that isn't shared by all runs grays out the `Ok` button and makes it so I am unable to create a custom chart. Filtering the query so that only runs have logged using the specified summary are selected does not solve the issue.

### Expected Behavior

I should be able to use summary keys in my custom charts that aren't set by all runs.

### Steps To Reproduce

See sweep workspace: https://wandb.ai/step-emg/Audio%20Signal%20Processing/sweeps/7hf398t3/

### Screenshots

Using `_timestamp`, no problems:

Using `Acc` (only set by some runs) - `Ok` grayed out and unable to make chart:

Tested with filtering for non-null `Acc`:
