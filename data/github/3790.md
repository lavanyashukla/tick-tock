TITLE:
[App]: Media doesn't display correctly in project page if some runs don't have media

LABEL:

STATE:

### Current Behavior

I have 5 runs, only one of which logged media (a video). I expect that the one video would fill the entire available size, but it seems that it's scaled to leave room for the other runs that didn't log any media. See the example:
<img width="1072" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5598968/173242125-e9d5292f-3fe2-4e56-a202-4d4979651635.png">

This comes up commonly when using the "group runs together" method of handling multiprocess runs - only one of the group will log media for a given key. And as-is they display really small, which isn't very functional.
