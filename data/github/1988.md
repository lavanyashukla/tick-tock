[CLI] URGENT! The Network Bytes Transfer Leak

**Description**

In the latest version of `wandb=0.10.22`, the Network Bytes transferred and received appears to increase drastically compared to a previous version `wandb=0.9.5` that I had been using. See [this report](https://wandb.ai/costa-huang/cleanRL/reports/Network-Bytes--Vmlldzo1NDY2ODg) for an example.

I have started upgrading `wandb` to the latest version a couple of days ago and start running experiments on AWS as usual. As shown in the figure above, the network transfer for the latest `wandb` version is several magnitudes higher (about 100x more bytes transferred) than that of the older version. This issue unfortunately is URGENT and has a devastating effect on running on cloud providers that charge for data transfer such as AWS. As shown in the figure below, the EC2 costs have increased 10-15x due to the `DataTransfer-Out-Bytes`, costing thousands of dollars more on the same workload (about 28 concurrent experiments overnight).

**How to reproduce**
1. Download the [source code] (https://wandb.ai/costa-huang/cleanRL/runs/1vq7p5se/code?workspace=user-costa-huang) 
2. Install the [`requirements.txt`](https://wandb.ai/costa-huang/cleanRL/runs/1sqc9tyg/files/requirements.txt)
3. And just run with `python sdqn_atari.py`
4. Then install `wandb==0.9.5`, and run the same script by `python sdqn_atari.py`
5. On the report page, select those two experiments and compare the network transfer

**Environment**
- OS: Linux
- Environment: my own machine and on AWS
- Python Version: 3.8.8 (see the report)
