Less intrusive application errors

Instead of displaying the Application Error page, let's change `displayError` to use the flash logic to display a message in the upper right hand corner saying either "Network Error" when we can't connect to the server.  You can simulate this by turning off wifi.  And "Application Error" for the other error cases.  Line 124 of apollo.js is an example of calling setFlash instead of displayError.  It's important to note that just checking for networkError this doesn't means it's a network error.  You'll have to reproduce by turning of wifi to ensure we catch that case.  All calls to displayError should be replaced with this approach for now.
