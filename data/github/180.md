Parallel coordinates hard to interact with

Vlad I merged your parallel coordinates stuff into my task/filters branch. Thanks! It'll probably be in master by the time you read this.

I think there's a z-order issue. If you create a brush on a dense part of a parallel coordinates plot, it's hard to move the brush. Also hard to create brushes generally.

This may have been an issue before as well.
