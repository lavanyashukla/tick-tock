TITLE:
Sync tensorboard stops working in upgrade from 0.9.7 to 0.10.2

LABEL:
bug,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I had been using [sync_tensorboard ](https://docs.wandb.com/library/integrations/tensorboard)with the [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) (`tensorflow==1.15.2`), but when upgrading to version `0.10.2` metrics are no longer logged to the wandb dashboard.

I have confirmed when downgrading to `0.9.7` the logging begins working again
