Roll back from local to cloud

I had wandb working on cloud.  Then I switched to local, and got "Retry attempt failed:" error.  I tried to switch back from local to cloud, but it seems that my system got stuck at wandb/local model.  Trying to "docker stop wandb/local", and ran the code again.  I am still getting the error:

TensorBoard: Start with 'tensorboard --logdir yolov5', view at http://localhost:6006/
wandb: Network error (ConnectionError), entering retry loop.

How do I switch the model to cloud to view training metrics at "wandb.ai/home".  

Thanks,
C. Chien
