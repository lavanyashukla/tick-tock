TITLE:
wandb.login() hangs and then disconnects me every time I try on Google Colab

**Description**
I've been using wandb and Google Colab successfully for the last couple of months. But over the last week, I have had so many connection issues. 

One thing that has been happening all morning (the last 4 hours) is that when I run this code block, Colab hangs, then disconnects, and cannot reconnect for several minutes.

```python
!pip install wandb -qqq
import wandb
from wandb.keras import WandbCallback
wandb.login()
```

It installs wandb and does both imports fine. But it hangs when it tries to do wandb.login().

Here's the [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13FeVuT9UTPab_oj7xW3S1f6ZTfvkhddo?usp=sharing) but there isn't much to see since no error message comes up.


**Environment**
- Environment: Google Colab
