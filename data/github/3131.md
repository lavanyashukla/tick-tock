[App] Bug: Incomprehensible section list when adding a panel to report

**Describe the bug**
From the sweep page, I'm trying to add a panel to a report. However, in the list of sections, I can only see "Section 1, Section 2, Section 3", which are incomprehensible. I have no idea what "Section 1" is, without seeing its title.

**Expected behavior**
I expected to see a list of the headers in the report (similar to the `/table of content` command)
