TITLE:
[CLI] Wandb Table is slow 

LABEL:
cli,c:table

STATE:
open

BODY:
Creating wandb Table from data-frame is very slow. I observed it with a data-frame having milliion rows.

Upon investigation, I found it to be because of iterative addition of data in the wandb table from the dataframe. I hope this could be optimized.
