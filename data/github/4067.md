hi,

I registered wandb on my google account by default, and after 250 hours of operation, it shows that I need to charge. I am an individual (academic) and I have re-registered an account with my school email. How to migrate my previous records.

I tried using wandb sync locally and it showed wandb: ERROR Nothing to sync.

what should I do?
