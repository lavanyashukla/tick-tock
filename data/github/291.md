### Description

Attempting to run wandb sweep without initializing the project.
Also specifying dryrun which probably shouldn't work with sweeps.

### What I Did

```
$ WANDB_MODE=dryrun wandb sweep sweep.yaml 
Creating sweep from: sweep.yaml
wandb: Network error (HTTPError), entering retry loop. See wandb/debug.log for full traceback.
```
The failure is because entity was not set.
