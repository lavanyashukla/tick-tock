### Description

It would be great if there is a feature that allows custom naming of the run. 

Instead of 6 random characters https://app.wandb.ai/user/project/runs/wsl8or9u, we can have something like https://app.wandb.ai/user/project/runs/13_layer_cnn_wsl8or9u or https://app.wandb.ai/user/project/runs/4_layer_rnn_wsl8or9u.

In my opinion this will be a UI enhancement as you can see which models result do you want to look at, instead of going through the entire width of the table.
