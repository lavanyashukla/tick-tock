[App] UI bug - unable to change size of column with run names in the workspace tab

**Bug Description**
Run names for experiments can often be long and so it's useful to change the size of the column displaying run names. When in the workspace tab i.e. with all the charts, the size of this column doesn't change when dragging on the separator between columns. My current workaround is switching to the table tab, changing the column size and switching back to workspace mode.

Not a big issue, just a UI bug so I thought I should flag it!


**Browser Details**
 - Browser: Safari
 - Version: 14.0.2 (15610.3.7.1.10, 15610)

Thanks!
