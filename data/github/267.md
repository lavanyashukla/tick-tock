File download fails

### Description

When trying to download a file via `wandb.Api().run("rmst/ssvg/rm8dpyrx").file('blip').download()` it fails with

```
500 Server Error: Internal Server Error for url: https://api.wandb.ai/rmst/ssvg/rm8dpyrx/blip
```

The download via the web interface works. The metadata for 'blip' is also available through the API. Just `download()` seems to fail.
