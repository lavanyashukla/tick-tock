TITLE:
[App]: Automatic focus in search bars inhibits use of keyboard shortcuts

LABEL:

STATE:

### Current Behavior

Many pages on the wandb web app feature a search bar that is **focused by default**. 

While this makes it easy to start typing a search query, it sucks up any keyboard shortcuts (most notably, command + left arrow and command + right arrow for moving back or forward in the browser history). 

Moreover, pressing escape doesn't remove focus from the search bar as one might hope. 

Fairly often I am looking around different training runs so I like to go back and forth in my page history with the keyboard shortcuts. 

### Expected Behavior

Perhaps a corrected behavior would either:
-  start without focus in the search bar, but any typing would automatically focus the search bar
-  start with focus, but allow certain keyboard shortcuts to work
-  start with focus, but allow the escape key to remove focus

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Enter a project
2. Click on a run
3. Press command + left arrow to go back in web browser history
4. Sadly, the last step does not work. however, if you click out of the search bar to disable its focus, then command + left arrow works.
