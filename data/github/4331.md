TITLE:
The server is uploaded with partial information

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
The data that is send to the server is incomplete (or logged from time to time and not at every epoch).
I am saying this because the number of epochs on the server is 72 whereas in reality is over 200 (when I print in jupyter notebook). The wandb sends data for just 190 epochs, although in the notebook the training is running to 1000 epochs. At the end of the training (1000 epochs) I receive this error:
`ConnectionResetError: [WinError 10054] An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host`
Can anyone please tell me what the cause of this error is and how can it be fixed?
