[CLI]: Faulty parse_path logic in wandb.apis.public.Api.run(path="")

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

From https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/public-api/api#run, I see `If api.entity is set, this can be in the form project/run_id and if api.project is set this can just be the run_id.`

The logic that parses path in [wandb/apis/public.py#L642](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/master/wandb/apis/public.py#L642) suggests otherwise and after I set both `entity` and `project`, just passing in `"run_id"` results in `entity/run_id/run_id` as `_parse_path()` treats `run_id` as the `project` as well.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
api = wandb.Api(
  overrides={
    "base_url": "https://base_url",
    "entity": "user",
    "project": "uncategorized",
  })
run = api.run(path="run_id")
```

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
ValueError: Could not find run <Run entity/run_id/run_id (not found)>
```
