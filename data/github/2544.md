TITLE:
[App] Logged audio not in sync in the app.

**Describe the bug**

I am logging a pair of audio files via `[wandb.Audio(..., caption="original"),  wandb.Audio(..., caption="reconstructed")]`, in the app I would expect that the left and right audios are always shown in sync (they come from the same time step), but sometimes this is not the case when I slide between time steps. Also the step sliders sometimes are not updated correctly when switching between runs.


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behaviour:
1. Go to https://wandb.ai/piter/trans?workspace=user-piter
2. Click select between 2 experiments (one has ~80k steps, another just ~2k), see that the steps from the large experiments are sometimes shown in the small experiment. Also observe that sometimes left and right audios are not in sync (coming from different steps).

**Expected behavior**

All the shown audios are from the same time-step, the leakage between steps should *never* happen as this is very confusing. If some audio files are pending load, then it is better to show empty space (or better a loading animation) rather than incorrect one. The sliders should be updated correctly when switching between experiments.

**Screenshots**
In this specific case the audio is in sync, this is to just illustrate how the logged audio looks like.
