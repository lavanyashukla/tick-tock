TITLE:
Syncing/deleting runs from a sweep

LABEL:
feature_request,c:sweeps,stale

STATE:
open

BODY:
I'd like to be able to sync or delete all the runs from a sweep (from my local machine) without having to figure out each of their separate id's and deleting one by one. 

Maybe a command `wandb delete sweep [sweepid]` would be nice. 

Thank you.
