TITLE:
[Feature] UI filter tags based on `in` or `.startswith(...)`

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I have multiple tags in the form of: "Error - ...", which I use to keep track of errors that occur in various runs. This makes it easy to see all runs with the same issue, but when you have many tags like this, I would have to filter "Tags" by each error tag. 
Ex. Filtering by "Error - 1", "Error - 2", ...

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great if we could filter tags that contain or start with a string. Something like python's `in` or `.startswith(...)`. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
(Please see first paragraph)

**Additional context**
An example of having to filter with each individual tag:
