Long time for process to finish on WSL

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
I am trying to save a very small tensor using wandb.save, but the process takes a very long time to finish. 

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
import wandb
import torch

project="test"
name="save-tensor"

wandb.init(project=project, name=name)

x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
torch.save(x, 'tensor.pt')
wandb.save('tensor.pt')

wandb.finish()

```

The line of the shell: / 0.006 MB of 0.009 MB uploaded (0.000 MB deduped) keeps running for 8 minutes at the end of the process. 

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
wandb: Currently logged in as: ******. Use `wandb login --relogin` to force relogin
wandb: Tracking run with wandb version 0.14.0
wandb: Run data is saved locally in ********
wandb: Run `wandb offline` to turn off syncing.
wandb: Syncing run save-tensor
wandb: ‚≠êÔ∏è View project at *******
wandb: üöÄ View run at ******
wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish... (success).
wandb: / 0.006 MB of 0.009 MB uploaded (0.000 MB deduped)
```
The tensor.pt file is uploaded quickly on the run page on wandb.ai but the program still runs for 10 minutes before ending.
PS: There is no problem with my internet speed. I checked the same program on Windows 11 and there was no problem. It seems to be specific to WSL.


Can someone help me with this issue ? (below you will find the log files for the run)
