TITLE:
Shared logging for launcher->worker scenario

LABEL:
enhancement

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Use case -- I run a command on my laptop (launcher machine), it reserves an AWS worker machine, uploads script and runs it there. Later, you want AWS machine environment for metrics, but also want info from launcher machine, ie original command line in order to be able to reproduce the same run.

Right now my approach is to only start wandb on remote machine, manually log things of interest on local machine => [pickle](https://github.com/cybertronai/aws-network-benchmarks/blob/aea459d5279121854024c6dfefd69cfbb7bd4c0d/nccl_bench2.py#L167) => upload to remote machine => unpickle => add to wandb.
