[CLI] api.sweep broken for large sweeps (read timeout)

**Description**
When running `api.sweep` with "large" sweeps (actually not that large, just around 180 runs), this error appears:
```
CommError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.wandb.ai', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=9)
``` 

I've realized that it also crashes when pressing the download icon in the wandb app, in the table view.

**Wandb features**
Just using the Python wanb api. 

**How to reproduce**
2 ways:
- execute `sweep = api.sweep("stardust-r/deep-learning-space-weather-forecasting/inztzkl4")`
- go to  the sweep in the app (https://wandb.ai/stardust-r/deep-learning-space-weather-forecasting/sweeps/inztzkl4?workspace=user-ecstevenson) and try to download the sweep table.

**Environment**
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04
- Environment: Jupyter Notebooks & docker
- Python Version: 3.8.5
- Wandb version: We've tried the multiple versions, including the most recent 0.10.19
