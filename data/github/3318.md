### Description

This is important to visually distinguish gt and pred detections without having every time to use the "eye" control.

Colors often can carry semantic meaning: 1) detection score, 2) IoU test success or failure etc

It also makes sense to allow to pass different colors for the box itself and for the box caption frame.
