How do you disable Weights and Biases?

Hi,
I recently started using WandB. I know this topic has been somewhat covered previously. **[https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/764](url)**
I did look at **wandb.init(mode="disabled")**
But does it completely turns of WandB or is there any other feature to set it to disabled mode just like this WANDB_MODE=dryrun.
I'm a bit confused about how to turn it off completely. Please help.
Thank you
