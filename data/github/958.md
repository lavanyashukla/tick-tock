### Description

Running a bunch of jobs where some of them proceed as normal and some of them display `ValueError: 'timeout' must be a non-negative number` which appears to crash the entire job.

The relevant line of code is [here](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/file_pusher.py#L319). Looks like for some reason the current time is greater than `batch_end_at`, causing `wait_secs` to be negative.

### What I Did

```
