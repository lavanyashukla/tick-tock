TITLE:
Two level logs

I'd like to log the values at two levels, I mean,

```python
iiter = 0
for epoch in range(1, 10):
    for batch in data_loader:
        iiter += 1
        loss = model(batch)
        ...
        wandb.log({"loss": loss}, step=iiter)
     ...
     wandb.log({"loss_mean": loss_mean}, step=epoch)
```

However, it shows "wandb: WARNING Step must only increase in log calls".
Is there a way to control two level values?
