### Current Behavior

I'm trying to re-order sections (chart groups) on dashboards. To do so, I click on the dots in the section header and try to drag it to the new position:

An empty space appears above sections and nothing else happens:

### Expected Behavior

I expect a drag-and-drop behavior of sections and successful re-ordering of them

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Open a dashboard (both project dashboard and run dashboards are affected)
2. Try to drag sections to re-order them
