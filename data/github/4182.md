[Q] Is there a way to automatically do a multi-line plot without using wandb.plot.line_series()?

Hi,

I have a `gym` environment made up of multiple 'teams' where I record `wandb.log(results)` each time I call `env.step()`. Amongst other step metrics, I am logging data of the form:

```python
results = {
                'team_1':
                    'metric_1': 10,
                'team_2':
                    'metric_1': 15
            }
wandb.log(results)
```

This plots `metric_1` for each team on a separate graph. To plot `metric_1` on the same graph for each team, I have to manually edit the graph. Ideally `metric_1` for each team would be automatically plotted on the same graph.

I know that `wandb.plot.line_series()` achieves this functionality, however each time I call `wandb.log()` I only have `int` or `float` values rather than a `list` because I make the `wandb.log()` call after each `env.step()` call rather than at the end of the environment episode. Unfortunately `wandb.plot.line_series()` seems to require that only one call be made to it, and each time it is called it overwrites previously logged `wandb.plot.line_series()` data (unlike `wandb.log()`, which appends to previously logged data).

Is there a way to do the equivalent of `wandb.plot.line_series()` but for `int` or `float` value logging so that I can automatically plot multi-line plots?
