Custom Charts: Export Panel Feature

**Description:**

I would love to see the ability to export custom charts from the web UI.

**Details:**

I imagine the implementation would be similar to the export functionality of existing charts. At the very least, I would like to see PNG exports at various resolutions. Currently, I have to take a screenshot of the chart at its native browser resolution in order to put it in a latex report. If possible, SVG exports that capture a static view of the chart would be excellent.
