### Describe the bug

I'm running wandb in Github codespaces and after launching the deamon via `wandb init` ... it starts giving me errors in the background. It's this one: 

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/python/3.10.4/lib/python3.10/threading.py", line 1009, in _bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "/home/codespace/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/wandb/sdk/service/server_sock.py", line 100, in run
    sreq = self._sock_client.read_server_request()
  File "/home/codespace/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/wandb/sdk/lib/sock_client.py", line 274, in read_server_request
    data = self._read_packet_bytes()
  File "/home/codespace/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/wandb/sdk/lib/sock_client.py", line 248, in _read_packet_bytes
    rec = self._extract_packet_bytes()
  File "/home/codespace/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/wandb/sdk/lib/sock_client.py", line 230, in _extract_packet_bytes
    assert magic == ord("W")
AssertionError
```

Every few seconds it pops up. No idea what's causing it. I can still use the terminal, but this is printed every few seconds.
