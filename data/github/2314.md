_(might be related to #1644 and #1650)_ 

I am training probabilistic generative models. During every epoch of my training procedure, I am logging images to WandB with a filename that goes something like `'%04d_prediction.png' % epoch` (so the epoch number is prepended with some trailing zeros), and in the client it becomes hard to find the latest visualizations generated by the respective models. Since the different ablation runs on my model run at different iteration speeds I'd ideally like to compare both the visualizations of a certain epoch as well as the latest ones.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In chart view, a "sort"-button with options to sort the charts/media by chart/file name, creation time etc. would help me greatly in comparing the generative performances of the model.


**Additional context**
I've looked around for possibly duplicate issues but didn't find them. Feel free to close this issue if applicable or if I just missed out on a way to achieve what I just described above.
