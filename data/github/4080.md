### Current Behavior

I have posted this [issue](https://community.wandb.ai/t/unable-to-login-using-wandb-local/2868) on the forum, but will detail it here as well.

I was able to log into localhost:8080 via `wandb local` last week with the same credentials I used to post to the wandb forum. However, this week those credentials are being rejected and I get an “Error while trying to reset password” message when I try to reset the password.

### Expected Behavior

To successfully login to localhost:8080 using `wandb local` and view the runs that have been synced.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. conda activate my_env
2. wandb local
3. In a browser navigate to http://localhost:8080
4. Click login
5. Use credentials to login
6. Credentials are rejected

### Screenshots

_No response_

### Environment

OS: Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS

Browsers: Firefox 103.0

Version: wandb 0.12.17


### Additional Context

Thanks in advance for your help!
