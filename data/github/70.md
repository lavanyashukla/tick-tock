### Description

If a user selects a project that isn't their own, we shouldn't upsert the model.  Currently we do it to set the git remote of the project, which might be something we can get rid of all-together.  Maybe we only call upsert model if the project doesn't have a git remote?  Unclear the best thing to do here.
