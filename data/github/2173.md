How to log best metrics in Table[Q]

BODY:
In **Keras** after training only `best_epoch` & `best_loss` can be seen in the **Table**. Is there any way to log the **best result** for other metrics as well like, `best_accuracy`? Unfortunately, `WandbCallback` doesn't show the **best value** for the metrics.
