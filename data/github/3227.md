TITLE:
[Q] How to change directory of `wandb.run.dir` post `wandb.init`?

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
By default, the logs for a particular run are saved in `wandb/run-20220208_000209-za6v4ogm` when `wandb.init` is not supplied with any directory. I want logs to be saved in directory after calling `wandb.init` without any `dir`. Is it possible to do that? I've already tried `os.symlink` for that but looking for a better solution
