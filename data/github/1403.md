TITLE:
why does wandb.restore() need a wandb.init()

BODY:
Hi, suppose I want to just download a pre-trained model for inference purposes without creating a new run via a separate script. Why do I have to create a `wandb.init()` to avoid the following error?

`wandb.errors.error.Error: You must call wandb.init() before wandb.restore()`
