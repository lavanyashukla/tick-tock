[CLI]: Can't resume run with correct id

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
I'm trying to resume a run that finished successfully. I got the ID from the W&B Web UI and have my training mechanism set up to resume from a checkpoint (so it will spit out correct step numbers, etc). What I want is to log more data to that same run as though it had never stopped.

So I do this:

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
run = wandb.init(id="g9jgwkjp", resume="must")
```

But then I get this:

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
wandb: ERROR resume='must' but run (g9jgwkjp) doesn't exist
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/davidg/.pycharm_helpers/pydev/pydevconsole.py", line 364, in runcode
    coro = func()
  File "<input>", line 204, in <module>
  File "/home/davidg/.virtualenvs/learning/lib/python3.10/site-packages/wandb/sdk/wandb_init.py", line 1144, in init
    run = wi.init()
  File "/home/davidg/.virtualenvs/learning/lib/python3.10/site-packages/wandb/sdk/wandb_init.py", line 773, in init
    raise error
wandb.errors.UsageError: resume='must' but run (g9jgwkjp) doesn't exist
```


### Additional Files

This ID does exist, I can confirm by looking in the web UI:

### Environment

WandB version: 0.14.0

OS: Windows 11

Python version: 3.10



### Additional Context

Perhaps I misunderstand what `resume` is supposed to do, the docs are a bit unclear. It seems like the assumption is that I'd only ever like to resume a crashed run. But what if I finished a run for a few epochs, and now I want to run it for a few epochs more?

I also tried `resume="allow"` and that doesn't seem to do what I expect.
