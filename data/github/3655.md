TITLE:
[Q] How to clear the run immediately after finishing the experiment?

BODY:
**Problem:** I'm working on a machine with limited disk memory. I'm starting hundreds of experiments overnight (due to many cross-validations), and sometimes the memory on the machine gets full because of storing wandb artifacts. When the memory becomes 100% full, all following runs get crashed.

**Question:** How to set wandb to clean the memory after a run (i.e., automatically call ```wandb sync --clean```)? I don't need to keep the artifacts on the machine.
