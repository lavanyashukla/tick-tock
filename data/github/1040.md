### Description

When I resume a run which was earlier killed, the metrics from the run do not line up correctly with previously emitted metrics.

State of metrics at the time the job was killed -

Metrics were logged at global steps 100, 200, 300, 400.

State of the metrics after the job resumed and completed -

I expected the metrics in wandb to be aligned when plotted against the global step as seen in tensorbpard.

### What I Did

wandb initialized in training script as follows -
```
wandb.init(
        project=project,
        config=config,
        name=name,
        dir=wandb_dir,
        sync_tensorboard=True,
        resume=True,
    )
```

Training ran for 400 steps, then the process was killed and exited with non zero status. Then the training was started again from the same directory.
