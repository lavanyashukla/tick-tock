Hi,
I was using `wandb.fastai.WandbCallback` with setting `input_type="images"` to send prediction images after each epoch to wandb app. It did send prediction images to wandb app but it did not show anything in _AUTO VISUALIZATION/MEDIA/Prediction Samples_ 
(it appears the message of "this run didn't log images for key "Prediction Samples, step 2, index 0." )
I digged into the source code of WandbCallback and replace the line 193 - `wandb.log({"Prediction Samples": pred_log}, commit=False)` by this `wandb.log({"prediction": pred_log}, commit=False)`, and it worked. Now the images can show in _AUTO VISUALIZATION/MEDIA/prediction_

Please help to check this issue.
