TITLE:
[Q] Organize simulations in sub-folders

BODY:
Is it possible to organize project/group of simulations in subfolder structure during the logging?
The command
```Python
run = wandb.init(project="project_name",
           group = '/Father_folder/Child_folder1',
           entity="Owner_Name",
           reinit=True,
           name = 'run_name')
```
Doesn't work. With it I'd like to reproduce 
```
project_name
├── Father_folder
│       └── Child_folder1
│          └── run_name

```
the above structure on the dashboard.
What I get instead is:
```
project_name
├── Father_folder/Child_folder1
│   └── run_name

```
**What's the right way to do it?**
