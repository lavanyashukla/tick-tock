It would be super nice if we could Export/Download the [table](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/data-vis/log-tables) from the Tables panel as csv (just like we can export the graphs).

NOTE: This is NOT the table of runs.

My use case is I'm logging table-data to wandb across runs, and I would like to download the full concatanated table as a csv.
