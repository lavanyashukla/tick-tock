TITLE:
Preserve job's stdout and stderr

LABEL:
enhancement

STATE:
closed

BODY:
We should save the jobs stdout and stderr. We should prefix each line with a UTC microsecond timestamp (timestamped on the client side, since the timestamp is used for interleaving), and call the saved files stdout and stderr in cloud storage. In the UI we can interleave these by default but give the user the option to show one or the other.
