TITLE:
Trainer terminated with OS disk quota error - wandb hangs forever

LABEL:
bug,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
In an environment with limited amount of files allowed in a partition, if the trainer process terminates with an OS disk quota error, then wandb process hangs forever waiting for the trainer process. It would be great to add a wait timeout so a GPU can be released as soon as the trainer terminates, for whatever reason. 
wandb client version 0.10.5 for Linux
