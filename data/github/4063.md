TITLE:
[Q] Is it possible to log a custom timestamp and use it as the "x-axis" for plots?

LABEL:
feature_request,app

STATE:
open

BODY:
Context: my validation dataset spans over a period of time, and I want view the model's performance at different time points.

Right now I can do the following:

```
wandb.log({"dataset_date": seconds_since_epoch, "metric": metric})
```

But in the UI the `dataset_date` is shown as numbers instead of dates. Is there a way to make the UI show this x-axis as time instead?
