Upgrading to the new version Wandb seemed to cause a breakage of SHAP in my PyTorch code

**Description**
Prior to upgrading to Wandb from 0.10.27 to 0.10.28 SHAP ` deep_explainer.shap_value(tensor)` ran without error. Now I receiving the below error:

```

Once I downgraded back to 0.10.27 the problem went away. I'm guessing this is related to the way PyTorch models are being watched by Wandb in the new ver.

**Wandb features**
Using Weights and Biases with PyTorch.
