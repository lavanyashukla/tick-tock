[CLI]: Start method = 'thread' not working

### Describe the bug

#1771 was still happening to me. It looks like setting the environment variable `WANDB_START_METHOD` solved the problem, but setting `start_method='thread'` in `wandb.init()` did not.

This did not work for me..

```python
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(start_method='thread'))
```

but this did.

```python
os.environ['WANDB_START_METHOD'] = 'thread'
wandb.init()
```

I'm not sure if this is a bug or if something else is going on. I'm using PyTorch DDP with torchrun.
