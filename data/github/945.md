### Description

I have been enjoying using Weight and Biases, and started using it daily!

However, I have bumped into some problems. After training a series of deep learning models, I am now trying to get one of the best results via python. Through this API (https://docs.wandb.com/library/reference/wandb_api#api%60.), I figured I could use MongoDB to get one of the top results like this: 
```
api = wandb.Api()
for batch_size in batch_size_list:
  runs = api.runs(
    path="my_entity/my_project",
    {'summary.train_loss': {'$lt': 0.01}, '$sort': {'summary.train_loss': 1}}
  )
...
```

However, I get this error message. 
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
...

  raise HTTPError(http_error_msg, response=self)
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://api.wandb.ai/graphq
```

I was expecting a list of runs with a train_loss that is less than 0.01 and is sorted in ascending order by train_loss. I was able to get a list of runs if I filtered it using `config.*`. 

Is this an expected output? If so, it would be generous to change the error message to something more informational than `requests.exception.HTTPError`.

Thank you in advance, and hope if somebody can help me out!
