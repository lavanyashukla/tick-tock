TITLE:
[Feature] Sync time zone information with server

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
My local machine has a wrong time-zone config. So when I ran wandb, the run was registered on the wandb server as running x hours ago, whereas it should only be a few seconds. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I think this issue can be solved by syncing not only the time but also the time-zone (absolute time?) with the server. I suppose this will also be useful for people who collaborate internationally. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None

**Additional context**
None
