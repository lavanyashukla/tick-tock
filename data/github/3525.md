### Current Behavior

When writing one experiment report using Chinese input methods, the behavior of the whole text input UI will behave abnormally.
To be precise, the abnormal behavior of the report editor page using Chinese input methods is:
1. When using English input methods, everything is good.
2. When using Chinese input methods (provided by macOS), after selecting the correct character with Chinese input methods, the location of the cursor will change automatically to difference places and two replicate characters or words will appear on this report editer even though I only input one character or word.
3. Problem also exists when using Japanese input methods.
4. Problem do not exist when editing the headline or the abstract for the report, only exists for the editing of the main part of the report.

### Expected Behavior

Have the save behavior as English input methods

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to create a new report
2. Type in the main part of the report using English input methods
