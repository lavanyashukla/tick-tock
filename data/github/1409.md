Error communicating with backend

Hi,

Sorry for creating this as a new issue, but technically it is. I added a comment to #1287 about this, but since it is a different problem, I thought it would be best to track it in a new issue. Copying the comment from the previous thread:

I am on version 0.10.4 of the client and I faced a similar error which I'm guessing is network error. It happened on one of the multiple similar runs.

From what I can tell, it seems something went wrong with login/init. Can the client circumvent this without crashing? Something simple I can think of is just allowing the user to increase the timeout, so the client just keeps polling the backend till it connects, rather than stopping the run. I'm not sure if this has problems I haven't thought about.

Thanks!

Here's the stack trace:

```
