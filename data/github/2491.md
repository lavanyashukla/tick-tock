TITLE:
[CLI] Syncing fails with 1062

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I have deleted a previous run and try to resync it from my local folder but get the following error:
```
409 response executing GraphQL.
{"errors":[{"message":"Error 1062: Duplicate entry '380294-aeb1d0e8d679770f37ff34ae53e4ec5a' for key 'PRIMARY'","path":["upsertBucket"]}],"data":{"upsertBucket":null}}
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: Error 1062: Duplicate entry '380294-aeb1d0e8d679770f37ff34ae53e4ec5a' for key 'PRIMARY' (<Response [409]>)
```

I've seen in other answers that with the API you can use the `resume=allow` flag, but how can you do that in CLI?
