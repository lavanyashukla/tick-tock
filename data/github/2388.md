TITLE:
[Q] How to access color values of grouped runs in custom charts?

BODY:
Is there any way to access the color value assigned to a group when creating custom charts?

It seems like the default query is extended with color information (`color` key) in RGB format, but it corresponds to the color of a particular run in the app. However, when enabling run grouping, the colors in the app change, and it's no longer possible to maintain color consistency between custom charts and default wandb charts. Is there some workaround to this? I think something like a `groupColor` column would help in creating synced color schemes.
