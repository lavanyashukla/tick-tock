TITLE:
[Q] How to continue run the unfinished specific sweep?

LABEL:

BODY:
I have several successful runs in a sweep. However, somehow I encountered a failed run for some unknown error. It's hanging for waiting the job, so I killed the process. How could I continue the run only using the unfinished config without restart the whole sweep?  I'll be very grateful for your help.
