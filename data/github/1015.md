### Description

I was logging a variable/value that is of type `set` this caused JSON serialisation issues, similar to the error reported here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8230315/how-to-json-serialize-sets (JSON serialisation failing when handling data with set data types).

Although the way `python` reported the error (low-level call stack information), it wasn't clear if it was caused by `wandb` coming from my code. I looked to look at it closer, googled and then looked at my last commit change lead me to the solution.

### What I Did

```
a = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
wandb.log({'metric': a})
```
Removing the line of code that logged the metric, resolved the issue. I then converted variable to a `list` and that worked fine.

I would suggest if we try to log an unsupported data-type, that warnings be reported during logging not when synchronising with remote. Also maybe some sort of error handling be introduced around conversions, so if they fail the user gets a call stack.
