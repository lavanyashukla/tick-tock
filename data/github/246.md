### Description
I run code that uses wandb library.  I get an error message "wandb.run_manager.LaunchError: W&B not configured, run `wandb init` or set environment variables." which is great but then I run `wandb init` and I get `This directory has been configured previously, should we re-configure it? [y/N]` which is weird.
