TITLE:
Failed to launch process without WANDB_DISABLE_CODE=true

LABEL:

STATE:

`wandb --version && python --version && uname`

* Python version: 3.7.1
* Operating System: Ubuntu docker

### Description

wandb.init() crashes with the following error: process did not respond.

Adding WANDB_DISABLE_CODE=True works, found during NeurIPS debugging session with @vanpelt. It seems to timeout on the git code and not recover.

So, something weird is going on with my GitHub repo. 

Is wandb trying to send diffs of new files? Because there are quite some, including some saved network checkpoints which are large.
