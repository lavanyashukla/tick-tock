TITLE:
TensorBoard: Embeddings visualization not supported yet

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
For a project, I create some .tsv files. They are saved within the TensorBoard dir. When this directory is e.g. /tensorboard/run20201711/, the files are saved under this directory. The attached screenshot shows such logging structure.

![tree-view dir](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50734087/99505549-416b4080-2981-11eb-8b13-2c2c6be08b9c.png)

I then check to see if I can visualize these files as embedding files (similar to [projector.tensorflow.org](projector.tensorflow.org)), in the TensorBoard tab on my W&B panel.
However, it greets me with no data found - all other metrics are logging fine, images and so are uploaded correctly.

From your documentation at [https://docs.wandb.com/library/log](https://docs.wandb.com/library/log), I found no way to manually log the files, since .tsv/.csv do not seem to be supported.

How can I sync the files to my W&B project?
