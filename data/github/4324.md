### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
I am trying to download some images from a long (28d+) training run. However I can't find a way to either:
- Specify the folder or file mask of what I want to download
- Download more than 500 files

This prevents me from downloading the files I need, as they are not in the first 500 files

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
wandb pull -p <project> -e <entity> <run_with_over_500_files>
```
