**Describe the bug**
In a Report, when I drag a side of an image to resize, it crashes the page sometimes.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to a Report with an image ([mine](https://wandb.ai/wandb/wandb_spacy_integration/reports/-insert-NLP-task-using-spaCy-and-Weights-Biases--Vmlldzo4NjM2MDk/edit))
2. Click on the side of an image
3. Drag right or left
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
When I drag a side of an image, it should adjust the size of the image.

**Operating System**
 - OS: macOS Big Sur 11.4
 - Browser: Safari & Chrome
 - Version Safari 14.1.1, Chrome 91.0

**Additional context**
I asked someone to reproduce and they couldn't so it seems to be an issue with my setup. It also works now, so it seems to only be an issue sometimes.
