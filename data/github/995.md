### Description

After each training step, I want to save my model and upload it to W&B. As per the docs on https://docs.wandb.com/library/save I tried different approaches and found they didn't have any effect. And found no model uploaded to the W&B run.

Also, the docs mention this: 

```
# Save any files starting with "checkpoint" as they're written to
wandb.save(os.path.join(wandb.run.dir, "checkpoint*"))
```

Does this mean the `checkpoint*` folder/files must be copied into the `wandb.run.dir` folder before calling the above command? I think if you copy a file or folder into the `wandb.run.dir` folder, it is sufficient to upload it to W&B, then we won't need to call `wandb.run.dir`.

Also this example https://docs.wandb.com/library/save#example-of-saving-a-file-to-the-wandb-run-directory, only works for `model` by frameworks that have the `save()` attribute. Models saved via this method become visible and recognised in the dashboard for that run. Also, if I save a model as a `pkl` file would the dashboard recognise it and display its properties? It would help to specify if file-extensions must be valid when saving and uploading models to W&B.

I think it will be great if you can enlist the model types recognised and the ones that are not i.e. models created via Pytorch, Keras, LightGBM, etc... and what we could do to make custom / non-supported models also visible.

### What I Did

I tried this:

```
filename = '/incorected/path/to/file-does-not.exist'
wandb.save(filename)
```
and I didn't get a warning or error that the file does not exist, then corrected it to:

```
filename = '/path/to/model-exists.pkl'
wandb.save(filename)
```

To fix the above issue, this what I did:

```
filename = '/path/to/model-exists.pkl'
copyfile(filename, wandb.run.dir)
```

Went to the dashboard and saw the model appear in the list of files (file with the `.pkl.h5` extension):

but clicking on the model gave me this (spinning wheel icon):
