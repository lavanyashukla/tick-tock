BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I regularly want to control multiple sweeps at once, and it's cumbersome to click into each individually.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In the sweep overview add all buttons that are in sweep control and make them work for all selected sweeps.
