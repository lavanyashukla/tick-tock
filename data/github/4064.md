### Description

W&B can log semantic segmentation mask and bounding box! It's a very nice job. But I am doing some research about instance polygon estimation. Therefore, I am wondering If W&B has a plan to **log polygon data**.

### Suggested Solution

We can use wandb.Image() to log mask data and bbox data by _boxes_ and _masks_ parameters. Adding  _polygon_ parameter to allow to log polygon data would be an excellent choice!
