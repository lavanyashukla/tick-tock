TITLE:
Each added image is stored as a separate file to disk

BODY:
Cluster environments often restrict the number of inodes per account/mount point. For example, the cluster of my organization has a limit of 1M files that can be stored in the partition for experiment artifacts. While the tensorboard client writes all resources (such as images upon `add_image`) to pb files, wandb client seems to store every image as a separate file to disk. This implementation causes the out-of-quota errors very quickly when running experiments on the scale of tens and hundreds in a cluster environment. 
It would be great to either add a flag to delete such temporary images upon syncing them to the cloud, or write resources into a single (or less) files.
