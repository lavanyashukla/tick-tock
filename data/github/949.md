wandb init ignoring project parameter

### Description

When I initialize a project with `wandb.init(project=wandb_project)` I expect the project to be `wandb_project`. 
Instead it is `path-to-script`. 
This changed in one of the recent versions. Now the only way for me to have the correct project is to run wandb init in all directories in which I have scripts, which is unfeasible. 
The project parameter in init should have priority over all other configuration options.
