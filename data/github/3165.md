TITLE:
[App] Line colours have identical default values for different lines

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
Many times, the line plot gives almost identical default colors to different plots. This makes it very hard to read the plots without manually readjusting the colors. It would be great to easily read the line plots, without having to manually choose different colors.

**Proposed solution**
Any of the two following solutions would be satisfactory:

(Preferred) Wandb automatically chooses different colors when the line plot is created
(Satisfactory) A "refresh with different colors" button inside the plot, picks different colors for the line plots, if the default ones are not satisfactory for the user.
