Currently syncing a run that has `config.json` gives the following error. The issue is due to the `user_config` variable being a file name instead of JSON dict in the referenced code. It needs to be loaded before calling `.items`
```
  File "/root/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/wandb/cli.py", line 447, in sync
    path, run_id=id, project=project, entity=entity, ignore_globs=globs)
  File "/root/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/wandb/wandb_run.py", line 355, in from_directory
    for k, v in six.iteritems(user_config)}
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/six.py", line 587, in iteritems
    return iter(d.items(**kw))
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'items'
```
