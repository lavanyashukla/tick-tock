TITLE:
SVG exported from W&B is not displayed in Overleaf

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

As mention in #1446 the SVG plots exported from W&B are not displayed correctly in Overleaf, unlike any other SVG I've tried. The error by Overleaf mentions a missing .pdf_tex file.

### Expected Behavior

The plots exported from W&B should be in a format displayable by Overleaf. 

### Steps To Reproduce

As mentioned in the issue #1446, to reproduce this, please try using the overleaf template from [the answer in this thread](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/442077/is-it-possible-to-use-svg-images-with-overleaf) and replace the svg with something exported from wandb: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21180505/152408705-a3b47923-ec64-47b4-b240-af43caf91d1f.svg)
