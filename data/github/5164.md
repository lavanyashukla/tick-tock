Hi 
I am a student who just started studying computer vision in Korea.
I have a question because I have a question while using yolov5 and wandb.

here is my question 
After creating my project and training the model, I checked the project on wandb and found that there was nothing related to GPU. I didn't seem to need any additional code to refer to other people's codes or docs, so how can I add things related to GPU usage?
