[Q] Setting WANDB_NOTEBOOK_NAME and storing Databricks notebooks in wandb

LABEL:

BODY:
Hi, I'd like to save a Databricks notebook in `wandb` and display it in the Code menu of wandb's UI. I am trying the following:

```python
import wandb
import os

os.environ["WANDB_NOTEBOOK_NAME"] = "/Repos/my-repo/my-notebook"

api_key = dbutils.secrets.get("wandb", "my-api-key")
wandb.login(key=api_key)

wandb.init(project="my-project", save_code=True)

wandb.log({"my_var": 123})

wandb.finish()
```

It logs the run and its variables as expected, however, I receive the following warning when running `wandb.login(key=api_key)` and it doesn't create a ` _session_history.ipynb` object:

```
wandb: WARNING WANDB_NOTEBOOK_NAME should be a path to a notebook file, couldn't find /Repos/my-repo/my-notebook
```

Note: Regular jupyter notebooks work fine, I only have this issue with Databricks. Any ideas? 

Thanks a lot!
