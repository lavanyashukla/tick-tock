TITLE:
[Feature] Rest API

LABEL:

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Having a Rest api to log minimal features in every languages (NodeJs for my useCase)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Having a Rest documentation on which (graphql) queries to make. 

If graphql is needed (as seen in the source code) then it's easy to install and use it in many languages. 

We would then call it to log In, get an API token and log metrics, enjoy the wonderful W&B features (parameters correlation, beautiful easy plots etc..)

We're not asking for the full api. Artifacts, sweeps, hardware is too complicated (or can come in a second time). 
But logging names or numbers like metrics (accuracy / logs) or confusion matrix, (maybe images) should be doable. 

By doing ML outside of the python ecosystem we loose many tools we really like and that could be really nice for many users (NLP in a web stack in our case).

We're willing to put efforts as it would really help our R&D / production pipeline. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
- Using MLFlow as they support REST Calls (but the interface is not as nice...).
- Using tensorboard (from nodejs) but they includes even less features than mlflow.

**Additional context**
We checked the code and it would be feasible but a pain to reverse engineer the small part we want. 

Thanks for the nice library. 
Have a great day
