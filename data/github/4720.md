TITLE:
[App]: Plot legend is cut off

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

The bottom part of the legend text can sometimes be cut off by the plot itself (when Legend Position is set to North) or the edges of the chart (when Legend Position is set to South).

### Expected Behavior

The legend should always appear in full.

Specifically, I see a few valid ways that this could be accomplished:

1) Shrink the "main" part of the plot to accommodate the legend

2) Automatically adjust the legend font size to fit the legend. Note, that currently the legend can still be cut off even if I set the font size to "small" manually, so this may not work.

3) Try to abbreviate the legend labels when they are too long to fit. I am not sure, how to accomplish this in a general way. Replacing the middle of the label with an ellipsis while keeping a unique prefix and postfix sounds like a reasonable first approximation.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create multiple runs with long names
2. You might have to increase the "Max runs to show" value in the "Data" tab
3. Observe, that the legend is getting cut off

Note, that there are 4 legend items that are completely hidden behind the main plot, so it's not just the last visible line of text that is cut off.
