**Description**
I deleted several jobs and after that, I was getting an error `"wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: Error 1062: Duplicate entry"`. I tried many different things to solve this error! None worked! Then I signed up for a new account but it keeps generating the same ID for different runs!
 
**Wandb features**
 wandb.init()



**Environment**
- OS: Ubuntu server
- Environment: Terminal
- Python Version: 3.8.*
