TITLE:
Create more frontend tests

BODY:
In general let's use the `yarn test --coverage` option to see where we're lacking on tests.  Ideally we would get the most files in the yellow. The following are places to focus

New pages: Signup, Team, Timeline, Dashboard (Skip AdminTimeline and Sweep for now)

Lets start with the following components, open to ideas on component testing frameworks / methodologies

components: Panel.js, PanelLinePlot.js, PanelRunsLinePlot.js, RunViewer.js

I know this is a big task, but as the codebase gets bigger, this is more and more important.
