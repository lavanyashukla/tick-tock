[CLI]: Pytorch lightning Wandblogger + wandb - nested metrics not being logged correctly to summary?

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
Hi, when I initiate a run with Pytorch Lightning's [WandbLogger](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/latest/extensions/generated/lightning.pytorch.loggers.WandbLogger.html), I find that nested metrics are unexpectedly no longer logged to the "summary" section of a run. 

Example: 
<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import WandbLogger
logger = WandbLogger(
    project="debug-summary-metrics",
    config={"p1": 1, "p2": 3},
    tags=["debug", "lightning"],
)
wandb.log({"m1": 10})
wandb.log({"train": {"m2": 10}})
wandb.finish()
```
results in

which is missing the `train.m2` metric.

Curiously enough, the charts do show that the `train.m2` nested metric exists, so it's being logged somewhere, but it's not visible in the summary section.

Therefore, when I try to retrieve the nested metrics using the Run API (`run.summary`), the nested metrics aren't there. 

Can you please help me figure out how I can retrieve these nested metrics? Thank you!

### Environment

WandB version: '0.13.5'
