hey! we have a checkpoint of 104.9MB in our wandb folder, and I notice it's not getting uploaded to the sync'd files. Anything I need to do to make sure large checkpoints get sync'd correctly?

It needs to go in the run subdirectory
e.g. `run-20190519_210753-p0uj0rqx`

It is under there. Seems like it actually attempts to sync the checkpoints all at the very end (note the models/iter_000150.model):
```wandb: Syncing files in ../../checkpoints/references/stylegan/wandb/run-20190521_191534-1s9ymt1c:
