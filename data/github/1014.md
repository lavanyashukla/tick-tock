Feature Request: Automatic updates

BODY:
wandb, version 0.8.35
Python 3.8.2
Linux

### Description

wandb already informs about a new library version, you update wandb very often (that's great, thank you for that!), how about you add the possibility that on new version detected you just update?
Of course add an option to turn it off, or only for minor version, so that nothing breaks. Thank you!
