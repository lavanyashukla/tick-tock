**Problem or Use Case**
So sometimes I have like 10 pages of charts in a panel and I would like to expand all of those pages.

However, dragging the handle in bottom right corner to expand all of them is a little inconvenient.

**Suggested Solution**
Add somewhere a small button which would expand all those pages.
