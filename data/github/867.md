### Description

I am trying to plot 3D models using the code:
```
wandb.log({prefix + " Mesh %d" % i: wandb.Object3D(open(obj_path))}, step=step)
```

This worked fine until I added the `step=` argument (so I could see the evolution of the meshes over time). I've checked that the steps are monotonically increasing between calls with the same key and that the keys are what I expect them to be.

Whenever a new mesh is plotted for a given key, the web UI shows two meshes beside each other and the controls stop working (see screenshot). The problem goes away when refreshing the page. 

The screenshot below shows the problem after several new steps have been plotted:

This screenshot shows the same view after refreshing the page (this is what I always expect to see):
