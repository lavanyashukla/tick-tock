TITLE:
Track edit history for reports

BODY:
It would be much appreciated to keep track of edit history for reports, to allow reverting accidental changes, attributing changes to each collaborator, etc. Currently there doesn't seem to be any functionality like this.

Example of an especially hazardous case: if you forget to clone another person's report before editing it, not only is there no way to revert these changes, but there is no way to show who is responsible for messing it up, and when :)
