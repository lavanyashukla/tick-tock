After I've run an experiment on a hyperparameter over a set of runs, it's helpful to be able to hide those runs as they get in the way when I'm trying to search for a run that I am currently using. It would be nice to have an "archive" tag that you could hide from searches unless you explicitly ask to search within archived runs.
