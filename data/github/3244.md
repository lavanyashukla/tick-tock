TITLE:
[Q]How do I get the best parameter config easily after using sweep?

BODY:
This is probably a dumb question. I'm new to wandb and I tried sweep for hyperparamter searching. If I'm interested in a couple of the experiments and hyperparameters in a sweep run, and I want to use the same hyperparameters to train a model and do more tests. How should I do that?
