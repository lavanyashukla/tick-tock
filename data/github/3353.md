### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
I'm using the API in the VSCode to export some data in table format. I noticed that calling `wandb.init()` and then displaying a run prompts an embedded w&b webpage where I shall log in. However, this web page is frozen. Clicking on any button doesn't do anything.

What can I do to be able to use the embedding webpage?
