### Description

I'm trying to put captions on videos in the Weights and Biases UI. When creating a video, I create it like: `wandb.Video(data, caption="caption here")`. But the captions aren't showing up in the UI under the videos.

### What I Did

Called `wandb.Video(data, caption="caption here")`

But getting videos like this (still image; the video itself is working):

These four videos are assigned different captions.

The captions work when I create an image instead of a video.

Thanks!
