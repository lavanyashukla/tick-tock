[Q] Notifications when sweep finishes

BODY:
**Is there a way to receive a notification (e.g., email) when a sweep terminates?**

**Context:** I'm using the sweep to set multiple experiments, in which I train one model over 1) multiple datasets and 2) with different sparsity losses. I run the sweep in grid_search mode because I want to know all the results. Then, I wait until the sweep finishes and analyze the results.

**Problem:** I can't estimate exactly when the sweep will finish. Thus, I'm entering the wandb UI multiple times whether the sweep has finished.
