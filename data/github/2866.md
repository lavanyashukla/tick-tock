BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I would like to use the paths saved in a reference artifact (stored in S3 or GCP) to be used in the same way as described here: 
[https://wandb.ai/wandb/arttest/reports/Intro-to-W-B-Artifacts--VmlldzozNTAzMDM ](url)
Without the need to use the data_at.download() function. 


**Describe the solution you'd like**
Something like data_at.get_reference_paths()
Returning a list of all paths, just like displayed in the Web Interface under Files. 
Then we can use the same logic as above to perform splits, alterations etc. 
This is especially useful when working in the cloud, where downloading the data is not needed, nor advised.
