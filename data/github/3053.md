Hello, I have question about visualizing image with wandb.

I want to visualize the images within the same step

I am using the code below.

```
    fake = wandb.Image(x_fake[0])
    real = wandb.Image(target[0])
    wandb.log({'fake': fake})
    wandb.log({'real': real})
```

but wandb is showing the different step of images.

I want to look in to the images with the same step.

not like 1162, and 1161 (image below)
