TITLE:
[Q ] Ignored wandb.init() arg project when running a sweep

Hi,

Every time I start a sweep, I get the message: 
`wandb: WARNING Ignored wandb.init() arg project when running a sweep `. The sweeps end up in a project folder called: `uncategorized`. This started to occur only when I created a new project. For my old projects, the sweeps are listed in the correct wandb project. When I simply run the project, without starting a sweep, the runs end up in the correct project.
 I initialize my project as follows:
`wandb.init(config=config, project='unet', entity='lucasdevries')`. My global WANDB_MODE variable has been set to 'online'. Am I forgetting something?

Thanks a lot,
Lucas
