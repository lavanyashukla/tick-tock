TITLE:
Website table displays columns which have no data

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
Here's my use case: I accidentally add a faulty field to the config when logging a wandb run. I realize the error, remove the field from my Python config, and delete the run which contained the faulty field. However, the field (which exists in no runs) persists in the table. Is there a way to "refresh" the table so it only loads columns which contain data?
