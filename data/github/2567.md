**Describe the bug**

Let me introduce the problem with screenshots. In screenshot (1), showing run 1 only, 10 random values are logged (a seed is set for them). The point 7 corresponds to 0.7887. In screenshot (2), showing run 1 and 2 , the same random points are plotted except that the step is set initially to 10. As you can see, the point 7 is replaced by a 6.5. In screenshot (3), showing run 1, 2 and 3, the same experiment is replicated (run 3) but the 20 points are logged at once. We can clearly see that the points are aligned and the point 7 has come back. From our observations, the issue seems to occur when there is at least one value mismatch. See run 4 in screenshot(4) which starts at step 1 and the grouping of both run 1 and 4 in screenshot(5). The issue is certainly due to the bucketing logic mentioned [in this issue](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/2384#issuecomment-878724949). 

**To Reproduce**
For screenshots(1-3)
```python
import wandb
import random

def log(id, nb_points=0, init_step=0):
    wandb.init(project="your_project", entity="your_entity",
               group="BUG" if id != 3 else "BUG-1", job_type=f"job",
               name=f"{id}", reinit=True)
    for i in range(nb_points):
        if i == 0 or i == 10:
            random.seed(1)
        wandb.log({"i": i + init_step, "value": random.random()}, step=init_step + i)

log(1, nb_points=10)
log(2, nb_points=10, init_step=10)
log(3, nb_points=20)
```

**Expected behavior**

The results of the grouping of run 1 and 2 should appear as in screenshot(3) and not  screenshot(2). In this case, I don't see why the 20 points could not be rendered correctly and why the bucketing logic should be applied in that case.
