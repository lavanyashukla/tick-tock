TITLE:
[App] Cannot select min/max values of log-scale parameters in parallel coordinates panel

LABEL:

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
When I run a sweep over a parameter with discrete values, and I choose to view that value in a parallel coordinates panel using the log-scale, I cannot select the runs with the min/max value for that parameter.  This always happens when using log-scales, and never when using linear-scales.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create sweep with discrete parameter
2. In the sweep page, go to the parallel coordinates panel
3. Edit the panel and turn on "log-scale" for the parameter in question
4. Try to select the min or max value of that parameter by click and dragging over the appropriate section in the parallel coordinates panel.  Do this by dragging from inside the panel towards the outside of the panel, so that you exceed the actual min/max value.
5. The selection will fail and a "No runs selected" pop-up will appear.

**Expected behavior**
I expect that I would be able to select the runs which have the min or max value for that parameter.

**Screenshots**
This screenshot shows how I try to select the runs:  I draw from the inside towards the outside, and release when I am completely outside the panel.  As soon as I release the mouse, I get the "No runs selected" pop-up.
