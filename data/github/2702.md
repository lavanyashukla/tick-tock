[Q] How to get wandb to work with multiple run slurm multi-tasks/multi-node?

**What I am trying to do**

I'm trying to run multiple configurations of my model using wandb (via Pytorch Lightning `WandbLogger`). It's working fine until I try to add more parallelism using the slurm task because my HPC cluster imposes a policy for a maximum submission with a maximum of 4 jobs. So, it's a waste to run 1 job with only 1 configuration. 
The problem arises, if I try to do n nodes m tasks per job (so I get n x m configurations per job).  This resulting the task of rank 0 gets logged but the rest aren't.

I tried wand.init(reinit=True) but with no luck.

**Environment**
- slurm job submission: submitit 0.12
- pytorch-lightning 1.13
