### Description

I was trying to do a hyperparameter sweep with the following `sweep.yaml`:

```yaml
description: try-out sweep
program: vertical.py
method: bayes
metric:
    name: RewardSmooth
    goal: maximize
early_terminate: hyperband

parameters:
    hiddenSize:
        values: [32, 128, 512]
    targetUpdate:
        min: 5
        max: 50
```

The `parameters` correspond to the parameters in my `config.yaml`, and the `metric` name corresponds to something that is being logged:

```python
wandb.log(
        {
            "Reward": accumulated_reward,
            "RewardSmooth": moving_average(accumulated_rewards)[-1],
        }
)
```

If I try to do a regular, single run, everything works just fine (logging of all parameters, models, weights, etc.). However, when I try out a sweep of hyperparameters with

```bash
$ wandb init
$ wandb sweep sweep.yaml
$ wandb agent SWEEP_ID
```

it seems as if nothing is happening. While the console outputs all kinds of stuff:

Runtime actually stays at 0 seconds, nothing is logged, and CPU/GPU are also not being used.

Anything you suspect that could be wrong? The documentation on what can serve as (valid) metrics is minimal, so when this is solved I can write some docs about that.
