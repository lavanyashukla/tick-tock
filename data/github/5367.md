### Current Behavior

Over the past few hours I've gotten several errors. Sometimes individual panels not rendering (after having rendered for a long time, so the config is fine) sometimes the Sentry "Crash report" window, I get that a few times a day.

In the dev tools console, a quartet of GraphQL errors occurred with the latest "It looks like we're having issues." crash report .
```
GraphQL error: An internal error occurred. Please contact support.
GraphQL error: An internal error occurred. Please contact support.
GraphQL error: Error 1040 (08004): Too many connections
GraphQL error: An internal error occurred. Please contact support.
 ```

Sometimes if flicks up a 404 message (replacing the whole page) when I haven't even touched anything.

And today a new one about it not being able to display my custom panel (after having rendered for a long time, and refreshing fixed it, so the error is incorrect in only giving me one option: to lose my custom charts). 

```
There was a problem rendering these panels.
Click this button to reset your workspace to the default layout.
This preserves runs, but custom charts will be lost.
```

And in the CLI network errors a few times a day (I have a rock solid network, usually coincides with some error in the web app so I assume WandB servers failing somewhere).

E.g. An internal error occurred. Please contact support
