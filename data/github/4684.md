GPU memory leak while running sweeps, cont.

# Description:
Basically same as previous post.
This is an old post and there wasn't really a solution to it, so I'm creating a new issue for it. 
# What I did:
I've read the issue and I'm also calling it with ```wandb agent blablabla``` and my program is structured like this.
```python3
if __name__ ...:
    """ some configurations stuff, all torch related stuff aren't here but inside the main function """
    main()
```

I'm actually still having this problem. And it's very similar to what happened before. nvidia-smi show nothing in process but memory is used. But in nvtop (https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop), it shows a ghost process there and it's using the memory. But it's not killable (i.e. killing it using the PID shown there doesn't do anything, but also nvtop failed to see the process command).

So in my experience, if that happens, the python process is actually still there. If I kill all process ```kill ( ps aux | grep <my python script> | awk '{print $2}')```, the memory usage will be gone. or another way would be I can also do ```fuser /dev/nvidia* -k``` to kill all process using the GPU (but it also kills all other process using the GPU, not very nice). So given such experience, would that make sense to say that wandb didn't actually cleanup the child process correctly perhaps? But the thing is it's not happening everytime. (like same scripts, training 1 epochs didn't have problem but 250 epochs had. could it be some other problems happening to wandb like network problem which makes this happened?) But it happens to multiple different scripts of mine which is quite annoying. (also not using wandb sweep was totally fine.) 

# Environments
My current wandb version is 0.12.17.

PS: I saw some comments on watching the model parameters (which I did use), so I'm trying to do it without the watch.
