### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
I am trying to fetch history, but it returns an empty pd.Dataframe when specifying more than 2 keys. With one key it returns the history of the specified key.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
 run.scan_history(keys=['key1', 'key2']) # return nothing
 run.scan_history(keys=['key1']) # return history for 'key1'
 run.scan_history(keys=['key2']) # return history for 'key2'
```

I assumed that more keys could be specified. Is it a bug or a feature?
