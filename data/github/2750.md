[Q] How to Log multiple times per second?

Hello
I am using `wandb.log({k: v})` multiple times per second -> I have ran into the warning you give in your docs:
> wandb.log is not intended to be called more than a few times per second. If you want to log more frequently than that it's better to aggregate the data on the client side or you may get degraded performance.

What can I do to upload aggregated logs to wandb? I can aggregate them in a `list of dicts`  on my side, but 
1.  how will this keep the order of "publishment"? running `wandb.log` keeps the temporal order of when the logs were published 
2.  I can't find anywhere in the docs how to push aggregated data and 
3.  I prefer using wandb to tensorboard, so i hope there is a way
