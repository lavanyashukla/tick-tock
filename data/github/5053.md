[Q] Duplicating the same plot for different run sets?

Hey, 

Thank you for all the great work! I've been trying to visualize my data in a certain way that I'll explain below for a day and I can't find a way to properly do it. So I thought maybe I'll share the problem here and ask if there's any way to get around it.

Problem: Let's say I have grouped my data by 3 attributes: A (which can have 2 different options), B (which can have 3 options), C (which can have 4 options). In total, based on unique values of A, B and C, I can have 24 groups. 

I've created a panel, that shows a plot based on data in each (of the 24) groups. I'd like to create a report that shows me 24 panels (all having the same code and plot, but with different run sets) next to each other. Is this possible?

Thanks in advance!

P.S: To make it more clear, I already tried duplicating the plot in my report and choosing a different run set for the duplicated plot, but when I change the run set, both the duplicated plot and the original plot's data change. It looks like I can only have one run set for a report. Is that the case?
