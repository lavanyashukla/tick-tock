TITLE:
[Q]Is there a way to stop wandb manually?

LABEL:

closed

BODY:
My training job will return -1 to stop itself and resubmit a resuming job when the left time is not enough. (I am using slurm, and there is a maximum time limit for each job)

However, I find sometimes wandb keep entering retry loop which keeps my job there without any computation. 
I am using wandb offline mode.
Do you have any idea why wandb makes my program there after a -1 has been returned in the main function?

Here is the log of the retry loop:

> wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish, PID 1957369
> wandb: Program ended successfully.
> wandb: Network error (ConnectionError), entering retry loop.


Here is the log of normal exits:

> wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish, PID 4046744
> wandb: Program ended successfully.
> wandb: Find user logs for this run at: /mnt/home......


Here is the code piece of my program:
```
def train(model, optimizer, lr_scheduler,scaler, corpus, train_data_iterator, val_data_iterator, args):
    ...
    if done and ((iteration+args.restart_iteration)<args.max_step):
        print("time left:", str(death_time - time.time()))
        print('| Running restart command:', " ".join(resume_command))    
        subprocess.check_call(resume_command)
        return -1

def main():
    ...
    ...
    ...
    if args.do_train:
        rt = train(model, optimizer, scheduler, scaler, corpus, tr_iter, va_iter, args)
        if rt == -1:
            return
```
And what I observe is the restarting log has already been printed to the output file:

> time left: 5575.794031620026
> | Running restart command: sbatch --job-name=train  ...... --eval_interval 4000 --wandb_offline

While the program was still there and I find 
> wandb: Network error (ConnectionError), entering retry loop.
in the error file.
