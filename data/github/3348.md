[Q] Using wandb with M1 Mac Rosetta

Hello dear WandB-Team,

I am currently forced to use a Rosetta-based Conda Environment as some of my ML Dependencies are Intel Architecture only.
When installing wandb through conda or pip within one of those environments I get the error message that WandB is requiring the AVX instruction set - which is not available within rosetta (as far as I know form googling the issue).

Any pointers on how to use WandB in this kind of environment?
