The problem is if I run many runs in a loop, every runs will last to the end of program but not the beginning of its next run.

according to the advice of #951, I tried 
```
import time
for _ in range(2):
    run = wandb.init(reinit=True)
    with run:
        run.log({'metric':10})
    time.sleep(10)
```
But still I got this

**Question**
- How can I make the run finished when init a new run ? (so it can record correct exec time)
- Does this mean if I run 15 run in a loop, I will get 15 threads exist at the same time ?
