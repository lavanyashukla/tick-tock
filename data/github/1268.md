TITLE:
Silent Mode Not Working in Terminal

LABEL:
bug,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
## Issue:
Silent mode doesn't seem to work in terminal. There are still lines with `wandb:` polluting terminal outputs. This is interfering with outputs of `tqdm` making my terminal logs unreadable. 

## Environment:
- python: 3.8.5
- wandb: 0.10.2
- tqdm: 4.48.2

## Reproduce:
```py
import os
import wandb

os.environ["WANDB_SILENT"] = "true"
wandb.init()
```

## Comments:
I noticed #457 mentioned that a fix was supposed to address this by August, did the fix not make it to production yet?
