TITLE:
ValueError: Tensorboard already patched

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
wandb, version 0.8.5   
Python 3.7.3 
Linux

Code to reproduce error
```
wandb.init(sync_tensorboard=True)
wandb.init(sync_tensorboard=True)
```

Throws:
```
ValueError: Tensorboard already patched, remove tensorboard=True from wandb.init or only call wandb.tensorboard.patch once.
```

Of course I wouldn't call two times init right after each other, but I regularly run into the error because I call my training script from a loop in a notebook.
Suggestion for improvement: Instead of raising the error, just not try to patch it again and accept multiple init calls.
