TITLE:
wandb local - endless "change password" loop

LABEL:
bug,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
wandb, version 0.9.4 (installed via conda)
Python 3.7.7
Linux

### Description

- Setup wandb according to quickstart
- wandb local
- Opened http://localhost:8080/home
- The screen pops up with "Change Password: Enter a new password for the account associated with local@wandb.com"
- I enter a password
- The same "Change Password" screen appears again...

### What I Did

- I can actually just ignore it and click the wandb logo in the top left to see my projects etc...
- However, when I want to access the linked tensorboard, the same "change password" screen pops up and I cannot ignore it any longer

### More information

- Top right button > Users > Teams reveals the following setup
- row1: {Team name: xyz, Members: local}
- row2: {Team name: wandb, Members: <empty>}

Probably something stupid, but don't know how to fix it and haven't found an existing thread
