### Description

Describe what you were trying to get done.
Tell us what happened, what went wrong, and what you expected to happen.

I've produced an artifact from a training run using run.log_artifact().  I see the artifact in the web interface and I am able to manually download it from there.  When I use the code under the "API" tab to use the artifact in a future run, I get an error.

### What I Did

```
