TITLE:
[Q] Local controller - stopping a sweep

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I am configuring a local controller to orchestrate my sweeps. However, I cannot find a way to stop the sweep through the python API.

```python
sweep = wandb.controller(sweep_id)
while not sweep.done():
    sweep.print_status()
    sweep.step()
    time.sleep(1)

    if len(sweep._sweep_runs) >= 10:
        print('Reached 10 runs, stopping')
        # sweep.stop() ?
```

How can I achieve that?
