View .sh files in the web app [Feature]

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I love wandb. I use save_code to save my code and often view it in the online web app. However, when I save a .sh file, the web app gives "File type unknown". I obviously can download the file and view it locally -- this is what I currently do. It's not a big problem by any means, but it would be really nice to be able to view scripts in the web app. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Display `.sh` scripts like `.txt` files or `.py` files in the web app files tab.
