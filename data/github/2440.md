TITLE:
[CLI] wand.run.dir points to root (/) when running in disabled mode

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
When wandb mode is set to `disabled` the `wand.run.dir` attribute points to `/`.  Is this by design or is it overlooked? 

I mostly use `wandb.run.dir` to store artifacts and saving them to root is almost never what I want (and fails due permissions anyway) Doesn't it make more sense to fallback to whatever was passed to `wand.init()`s `dir` argument or CWD?
