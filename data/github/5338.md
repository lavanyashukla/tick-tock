[App]: In model registry, the "+" for the alias gets hidden if there are too many aliases

LABEL:

STATE:

### Current Behavior

If there are "too many" aliases already associated with an artifact in model registry (in my case, four seems to be too many), the "+" button to add a new one gets pushed out of view, and can't be reached (it does not scroll). In order to be able to click it, we need to zoom out.

Standard view:

Zoomed out:

The same thing happens on a standard Artifact page.

### Expected Behavior

We should be able to add another alias without needing to zoom out

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create an artifact
2. From the artifact page, add several aliases until they don't fit in the available space
