TITLE:
wandb.watch doesn't work with modules that return dicts

* Operating System: Manjaro Linux 20.0.3

### Description

When I use `wandb.watch(model)` in a model of mine, I get a `StopIteration` message and my program crashes. When I comment that line out, everything works fine.

Two things my model does that could be considered non-standard are the use of some neural network layers from PyTorch Geometric and the output of a dictionary instead of a tensor. In the traceback I provide below, the error occurs exactly in a layer that returns a dict, so I believe the dict is the culprit.

### What I Did

```
Traceback (most recent call last):

    OffPolicySMACRunner(trainer).run()

StopIteration
