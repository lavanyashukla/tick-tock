### Description

I'm trying to use `wandb.plots.ROC` to plot a ROC curve for a two-class classification problem.
I'm executing it just like in this example: 

```
wandb.log({'roc': wandb.plots.ROC(y_true, y_probas, labels)})
```

### What I Did

In my case, `y_true` has shape (n, ) and `y_probas` also has shape (n, ). 

Each element of `y_true` is an int (0 or 1), and each element of `y_probas` is the predicted probability in range (0, 1). I'm also using `labels=['class 1', 'class 2']`

But I'm getting this error message: 

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "teacher.py", line 407, in <module>
    training_history = train(config, vox, d, predictor, label_out)
  File "teacher.py", line 258, in train
    wandb.log({'ROC': wandb.plots.ROC(y, y_preds, lb)})
  File "/home/mpds/miniconda3/envs/docktdeep/lib/python3.7/site-packages/wandb/plots/roc.py", line 71, in roc
    return roc_table(fpr_dict, tpr_dict, classes, indices_to_plot)
  File "/home/mpds/miniconda3/envs/docktdeep/lib/python3.7/site-packages/wandb/plots/roc.py", line 50, in roc_table
    fpr_dict[i], tpr_dict[i], _ = roc_curve(y_true, probas[:, i],
IndexError: too many indices for array
```

It seems that what is causing the error is this statement: `probas[:, i]`.

In the docs it's written (without mention to what shape these should be): 
```
y_true (arr): Test set labels.
y_probas (arr): Test set predicted probabilities.
```

I've looked into the source code and examples, but I wasn't able to understand what shape is expected of `probas` for the binary classification case.

Thanks.
