TITLE:
Google Colab hangs on training interruption and restart

LABEL:

BODY:
**Description**
For complete example please see the link below. I use pytorch-lightning wandb logger, but not sure if it is the culprit. What I'm doing is I run trainer, then interrupt execution, then continue training, then interrupt again - and after that everything stops working: any subsequent cell run will hang without ability to interrupt (only reset works). Also notebook stops saving. You can find output of debug.log in the notebook below.
