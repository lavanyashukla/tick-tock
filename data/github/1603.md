TITLE:
Scatter plot does not correctly compute running average line

LABEL:
bug,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
The running average line appears to be off, based on visual inspection. It looks like points which correspond to the same x-value are being assigned to different x-values and therefore not being aggregated in the same mean.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open a sweep.
2. Click on the '+' in a panel to create a scatter plot. Plot a hyperparameter against some metric like reward or error.
3. Click the annotations tab and select the "Plot running average y values" checkbox.
4. Click ok.

**Expected behavior**
I expect the plotted average line to correspond to my visual intuition based on the placement of points on the graph. I also expect the line to not have discontinuities at each y-value where points are plotted.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
