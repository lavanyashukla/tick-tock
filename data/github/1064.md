TITLE:
Git diff & code saving not working for Ray Tune

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
`wandb --version && python --version && uname`

* Weights and Biases version: 0.8.36
* Python version: 3.7.7
* Operating System: Ubuntu

### Description

My app uses Ray Tune's `tune.run_experiments()` and `tune.Trainable` to launch everything.  In particular `wandb.init()` is called inside `Trainable._setup()`.  

Expected behavior: I'd expect Git SHA, code diff saved with respect to my app (`~/app/run.py`, where `~/app` is a Git directory).

Current behavior: No Git SHA; code saved to W&B is `/home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/exp/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ray/workers/default_worker.py`.  This is the main program that launches a Ray worker that holds a `Trainable` object.
