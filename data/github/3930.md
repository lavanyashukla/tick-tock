The legend is bugged: these little hollow squares appear rather than the little lines that should appear normally. Has been happening on all my plots for a while now, no idea why.

### Expected Behavior

Lines to appear normally in the legend

### Steps To Reproduce

Plot any lines in the web app and check the legend (this has been happening for my project, not sure if this is easily reproducible for others)
