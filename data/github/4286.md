Machine takes far too long for wandb to finish to process wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish... (success)

Hello all,
I've been trying to use a sweep on wandb, and while it does work, it seems to take way too long between runs, with the console remaining on:
`wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish... (success)`
for upwards of an hour before starting the next run. When I check the sweep table online, it says the run is still running.
EDIT:
It seems that for whatever reason, the upload size on each run is over a gigabyte, which is strange since it is using the default callback commands.
