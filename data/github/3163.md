TITLE:
[Feature] Not all weights are logged. Only two, and names are assumed.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The histograms of weights in the WandbCallback() are only taken when there are 1 or 2 weights in the keras Layer.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I don't know why specifically the code is like this, but I don't see a problem with doing it just like TensorBoard does: process all the weights and take their name. Weights have names. It's kinda weird to assume that they would be "weights" and "biases", just because there are two. TensorBoard does this:

**Additional context**
I'm having a custom layer with more than 2 weights Variables (added through `self.add_weight()`), which are definitely not just "weight" and "bias". More specifically, I have an RNN with a custom cell that implements a Dense MLP inside with skip connections. So yeah, it's slightly more complicated than just one "weight" and one "bias".
