Is it possible to modify the entity of existing experiments? [Q]

BODY:
My account belongs to three teams. A group of experiments from one project accidentally fall into the entity of the wrong team. How can I modify the entity of existing experiments? Moreover, after I eventually change the entity, I still need to be able programmatically to access the information of the runs. Thank you
