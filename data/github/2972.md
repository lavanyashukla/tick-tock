BODY:
I am a newbie, I observed when the new account logins, the old Key API has covered the specified file, such as /Home/xxx/.netrc, does this mean that the account login is loaded from here when the ' wandb' is started? If so, can I specify this file name instead of the default?
In other words, can I run two accounts at the same GPU, if can, how should I do it?
