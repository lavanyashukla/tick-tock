TITLE:
[App]: sweep UI - axis range hides all runs and can't be found or removed

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

On the app's Sweep workspace page, I got into a state where all runs are hidden and there's no way I can tell to get out of it.  The error message states that a range on a parallel coordinates or scatter plot is hiding the run, for every run. However, I could not find any such ranges on my plots to remove. I tried deleting all of the panels, but the filter remains. No way to see any data now.  

### Expected Behavior

The UI should indicate to me exactly how to lift whatever filter is hiding all runs (the current message is so vague as to be unhelpful).

Additionally, if the panels causing the hiding are deleted, the filtering should be lifted and the sweep runs should reappear.

### Steps To Reproduce

Unfortunately I don't have exact reproducing steps but it involved inadvertently selecting a small range on a scatterplot that filtered out all runs, and then being unable to remove this filter in any way. 

### Screenshots

See Sweep workspace. All runs hidden, no panels left (all deleted). No way to remove the offending filter. Is this sweep dead now for visualization purposes?
