[Feature]: random sweep without replacement

### Description

Random sweeps are helpful for getting a sense of results much quicker than grid searches, but for discrete search spaces, they waste time replicating runs, and for a fixed duration, may not fully tile the space as desired. It would be great to have a hybrid sweep type used for discrete searches, that simply randomizes the order of a grid search.

thanks for all your work building a great package and application!

### Suggested Solution

call it randomgrid or something like that. it is a grid search in random order, a.k.a a random search without replacement.
