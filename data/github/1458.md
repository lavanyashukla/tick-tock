Wandb creates unwanted cell outputs in jupyterlab

Hi

I notice that when I using wandb client in jupyter lab, I get cell outputs that I don't want, are quite big and I can't remove them. They make reading notebooks difficult. I get this behaviour with `wandb.init()` and `wandb.run.finish()` as you can see:

I tried to use `%%capture` ipython magic. It suppress any output with `wandb.init()`. However, it breaks `wandb.run.finish()`, either running in `wandb.init()` cell or in the same cell where `wandb.run.finish()` is. I also tried to silence W&B messages as said in [docs](https://docs.wandb.com/library/integrations/jupyter#silence-w-and-b-info-messages) without success :( 

So, I would like to request a way to suppress them.

I'm using wand 0.10.8 and jupyter lab 2.2.3. I think that this doesn't happen in colab.
