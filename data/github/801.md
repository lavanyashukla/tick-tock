### Description
It would be nice if `tune.WandbLogger` would use the `tune.run` name as the run display name by default. Currently, when run with something like:
```python
from ray import tune
from wandb.ray import WandbLogger

tune.run(
    ExperimentRunner,
    name='this could be the default display name for wandb run',
    loggers=[WandbLogger],
    ...,
)
```
the display name gets randomly chosen (e.g. fanciful-wildflower-3). I was expecting the `tune.run` name to get picked up by the logger and be used as the display name by default.
