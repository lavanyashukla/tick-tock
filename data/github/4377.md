TITLE:
[Q] Track to one run from different processes

LABEL:
c:rewind

STATE:
open

BODY:
I have a main process that tracks itself to run:

```
import wandb
run = wandb.init(project="demo")
run.config.update({'aaa': 'bbb'})

<....> # do something for a long time

run.finish()
```

But this process starts for example docker container that also wants to track something to the same run:

```
import wandb
run = wandb.Api().run("<url to the same run>")
run.config.update({'ccc': 'ddd'})
run.save()
```

This update works, server updates run.config indeed (we can see config as {'ccc': 'ddd'}).

But when main process finishes, it erases all previous changes to run from other processes, so config is now {'aaa': 'bbb'} instead of merging previous changes with new changes and getting {'aaa': 'bbb', 'ccc': 'ddd'}.

Is there a way to track these changes without conflicts like this?

All I can imagine is to implement a merge myself right before "run.finish()" in main process:
```
run_on_server = wandb.Api().run("<url to run>")
merged_config = dict(run.config)
merged_config.update(run_on_server.config)
run.config.update(merged_config)
run.finish()
```
And probably I should add merging of artifacts and maybe something else (what else?).

Is there a native way to merge two version of run?
