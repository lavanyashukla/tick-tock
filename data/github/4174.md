TITLE:
[App]: Shift+click to select a range of runs

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

Shift affects webpage text selection, but not selection of the runs in the Runs Table.

### Expected Behavior

Shift+click selects a span of runs: from a previously clicked run to the presently clicked run.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to **Table** view, so that the header reads `username > Projects > projectname > Table`.
2. Click on tickbox ## 1 (*not* the header tickbox)
3. Click on tickbox ## 3
