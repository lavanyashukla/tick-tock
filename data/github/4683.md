### Current Behavior

I serialized a pointcloud according to this template in the docs:
```
# Log points and boxes in W&B
point_scene = wandb.Object3D({
    "type": "lidar/beta",
    "points": np.array(  # add points, as in a point cloud
        [
            [0.4, 1, 1.3], 
            [1, 1, 1], 
            [1.2, 1, 1.2]
        ]
    ),
    "boxes": np.array(  # draw 3d boxes
        [
            {
                "corners": [
                    [0,0,0],
                    [0,1,0],
                    [0,0,1],
                    [1,0,0],
                    [1,1,0],
                    [0,1,1],
                    [1,0,1],
                    [1,1,1]
                ],
                "label": "Box",
                "color": [123, 321, 111],
            },
            {
                "corners": [
                    [0,0,0],
                    [0,2,0],
                    [0,0,2],
                    [2,0,0],
                    [2,2,0],
                    [0,2,2],
                    [2,0,2],
                    [2,2,2]
                ],
                "label": "Box-2",
                "color": [111, 321, 0],
            }
        ]
      ),
      "vectors": np.array(  # add 3d vectors
          [
              {"start": [0, 0, 0], "end": [0.1, 0.2, 0.5]}
          ]
      )
})
wandb.log({"point_scene": point_scene})
```
Logging concluded without error. In the web interface, I read the following error: 

```
Error: Provided corners do not form a box
```

Could this error be displayed during serialization with an indication which of the boxes (corners) doe not form a box?
