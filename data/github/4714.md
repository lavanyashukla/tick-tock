[CLI]: Incorrectly detects running in Jupyter (in PyCharm Console)

### Describe the bug

PyCharm has the option to use IPython in the console:

With this set, W&B incorrectly returns `True` for the `in_jupyter()` check ([in this code](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/main/wandb/sdk/lib/ipython.py#L37)). It appears to conflate "in Jupyter" with "in IPython" in this case.

The result is output like the following:

And no way to override it that I can tell (maybe with environment variables?).

I believe `'ipykernel' in sys.modules` in a more robust check for whether or not you're in Jupyter, although I only tested in Google Colab, PyCharm (with IPython), IPython, and a vanilla Python repl. And obviously you need to check this before you import `ipykernel`.

There's a second issue actually: you're importing `ipykernel` in `jupyter_servers_and_kernel_id()`, even though you're not in Jupyter, which means if any other packages use `'ipykernel' in sys.modules` to test if they're in Jupyter, they'll erroneously return `True` if the user is using W&B with the setup I've described.

Perhaps the most robust way is to use `_repr_html_` as described in https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/integrating.html. This is what Pandas does.
