TITLE:
[Feature] make histograms work with cuda tensors

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Because histograms use np.histogram, they don't work with cuda tensors. Instead, you have to detach the tensor, then  transfer it to the CPU, which is a hassle and slower, and isn't consistent with other data types that do work with cuda tensors.
**Describe the solution you'd like**
Make histograms natively support cuda tensors.
**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Just using the workaround as normal
