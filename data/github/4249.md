[Feature]: Support meta data config for sweeps

### Description

Hi,

I use sweeps to benchmark RL policies on a range of different environments. For this purpose it would be really nice to upload the original config of the policy as meta data for the entire sweep. Right now I generate a json string and add it as description to the sweep config, but of course it would be much more convenient to have the same (awesome üëçüèº ) searchable config viewer that is available for single runs.

### Suggested Solution

Allow uploading a meta config dict along the sweep config.
