**Describe the bug**
I'm running a sweep. I started 6 agents in parallel with that sweep id. All going fine. Then I started another 6 agents with the same sweep id in a different parallel process. Working fine at start, but after a while, I started seeing the following error on every log step:

`wandb: ERROR Dropped streaming file chunk (see wandb/debug-internal.log)
ERROR:root:dropped chunk 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://api.wandb.ai/files/[ENTITY]/[PROJECT]/c60hxx3a/file_stream
NoneType: None`

The file `wandb/debug-internal.log` is blank.

Any ideas on what might be going wrong?
