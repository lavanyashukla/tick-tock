### Description

I have implemented W&B callback for LightGBM (`wandb_lightgbm_callbacks()`) is just like shown in the docs: https://docs.wandb.com/library/frameworks/lightgbm

But do not see any metrics or anything reported in the dashboard, other than the config and metrics sent via the `wandb.config` and `wandb.log()` calls.

### What I Did

Checked debug logs to see if any failures regarding the callbacks were reported. And found nothing out of the ordinary.
