TITLE:
[Q] Does define_metric allow a summary based on the point in time where another metric performs best?

LABEL:
c:core,c:define-metric

STATE:
open

BODY:
A fair summary of a model should be specified based on the same checkpoint and not different checkpoints where the individual metrics are performing at their best. 

I can see that define_metric has the summary = 'best' option along with a goal = 'minimize' / 'maximize', but as I understand it, I cannot let the goal be based on another metric. Is that so?

For instance, I would like to have a summary including the loss and the accuracy at the point in time, where the accuracy is highest.
