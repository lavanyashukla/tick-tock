TITLE:
Feature request: Tooltips for column headers in run overview 

LABEL:
enhancement

STATE:
closed

BODY:
There's no way to make last column wider, so header gets cut-off (ie [here](https://app.wandb.ai/yaroslavvb/nccl_bench?workspace=user-yaroslavvb)) and impossible to read. A quick fix would be to add tooltip on hover -- show full name of the header
