TITLE:
[App]: Experiment name shadowed by the "green circle"

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

The last two characters of an experiment name are being shadowed by the little "green circle" indicating that the experiment is online and running. When the name is too long to fit in the default view, even expanding to the right to see the full name doesn't move the green circle from the last two characters.

### Expected Behavior

To see the full name of the experiment.
