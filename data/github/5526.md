TITLE:
[Q] wandb.watch with model inherited from multiple parents

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
open

BODY:
I have model that inherits nn.Module and also AbstractModel class. In the AbstractModel class there are many things to load model, export model, do some logging etc. 

However, problem is, when I use 

`wandb.watch(model, log="all")`

it crashes with:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\perry\.conda\envs\nnframework\lib\multiprocessing\popen_spawn_win32.py", line 93, in __init__
    reduction.dump(process_obj, to_child)
  File "C:\Users\perry\.conda\envs\nnframework\lib\multiprocessing\reduction.py", line 60, in dump
    ForkingPickler(file, protocol).dump(obj)
AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'TorchHistory.add_log_parameters_hook.<locals>.<lambda>'
```

How to solve this?
