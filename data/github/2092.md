TITLE:
[CLI] wandb.init() hanging in the multiprocessing.Process()

LABEL:

BODY:
**Description**
wandb.init() hanging in the `multiprocessing.Process()` while the sweep

**Wandb features**
* [wandb Cross-Validation example](https://github.com/wandb/examples/tree/master/examples/wandb-sweeps/sweeps-cross-validation)
* [simpletransformers](https://simpletransformers.ai/) integration
* wandb.init()

**How to reproduce**
1. There is the [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RkNeXFuiXS_h5HFmy3Eeek2-MJf2HgVM?usp=sharing).
2. Run all cells, but don't forget to restart the env after simpletransformers installation
3. You will see that nothing happens after sweep initialization

**Environment**
- OS: Linux-4.19.112+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic
- Environment: Google Colab
- Python Version: 3.7.10

I am trying to make Cross-Validation based on wandb Cross-Validation example for simpletransformers hyperparameter tuning using Colab.

But there is a hanging problem at the moment of calling 
```
run = wandb.init(
        group=worker_data.sweep_id,
        job_type=worker_data.sweep_run_name,
        name=run_name,
        config=config,
    )
``` 
in the `train()` function, which is in the `multiprocessing.Process()`  according to the official example.

Docs says something about it

> Hanging at the beginning of training
If launching the wandb process hangs, it could be because the wandb multiprocessing is interfering with the multiprocessing from distributed training. Try setting the WANDB_START_METHOD environment variable to "thread" to use multithreading instead.

but either it doesn't help or I doing something wrong by adding `settings=wandb.Settings(start_method="thread")` to the code above and to the `wandb.init()` in `main()`.

I tried to run wandb CV example and it finished without any problems.
Also I tried to run my script similar to official example (using _.yaml_ file with my parameters and _.py_ with scrip) and it looked like script passing everything from `wandb.init()` to end in `train()` function.

I also found #1771 seems similar to this problem.
