Integration: Project renaming breaks TensorBoard loading

**Describe the bug**
I am using TF 2.3.1 and wandb 0.10.10., and Safari.

I log the data via the TensorBoard callback for keras, and set sync_tensorboard to True. With this settings, everything worked fine the last days. I did not change anything.
As of today, I can not visualize the logged data in TB, this is also for some older logs I did (weeks ago). It says no data, but I can recall using this visualization on this exact run with success.

On my two runs I did yesterday and this morning, I also log data, but the TensorBoard screen stays empty.
I **can't** seem to reproduce this behavior, for the following toy example it works fine:

```
from tensorflow import keras
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import itertools, io, sklearn.metrics, os

!pip install wandb

import wandb
wandb.login()

def do_stuff():
  import tensorflow as tf
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, Reshape
  from tensorflow.keras import Sequential

  model = Sequential([
    Input(shape=(128)), 
    Dense(20, name="test1"),           
    Dense(3)
  ])

  wandb.init(sync_tensorboard=True)
  wand_cb = wandb.keras.WandbCallback('val_sparse_categorical_crossentropy')

  inp = tf.random.uniform([128, 128], dtype=tf.float32)
  labels = tf.random.uniform([128], 0, 3, dtype=tf.int32)
  labels = np.random.randint(0, 3, size=(128))
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=["sparse_categorical_accuracy"])
  #model.summary()

  tb = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir="test")


  model.fit(inp, labels, epochs=10, callbacks=[tb, wand_cb])
  print(wandb.run.name)
  wandb.finish()
```

I noticed that I exceed the storage limit by 8 GBs, can this infer? (Also suggesting to send users a notification if quota is reached).
