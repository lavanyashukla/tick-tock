[Q] Can't find solution to a run error regarding artifact name being too long

Hi, 

I'm new to wandb, but really liking the features. I started a new project recently and keep getting this error whenever I run it:

```wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: invalid artifact name <long name here>, must be 128 characters or less (<Response [400]>)```

However, I'm not setting this artifact anywhere--it seems to be autogenerating. So I'm not sure what to change in order to avoid this issue. Thanks!
