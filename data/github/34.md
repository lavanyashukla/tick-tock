TITLE:
Consider run_id generation strategy

BODY:
Currently we generate run_ids as a random combination of 6 letters and digits. There are 36**6 = ~2billion possible combinations. Is this enough to make collisions extremely unlikely, given the birthday problem?

'latest' has a special meaning when used as a run_id. Should we blacklist it from being generated? Probably.

We've also discussed using a monotonically increasing number per project as the run_id.
