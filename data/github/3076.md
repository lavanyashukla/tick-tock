**Describe the bug**
I have been experiencing several issues in the past few days when using the wandb dashboard. Some of the issues I am facing include:
- Unable to delete an individual run (the 'delete run' option is greyed out)
- When I select multiple runs (either to add tags to these runs or to delete them), the options at the top to tag the runs or to delete the runs are greyed out (do not work).

I have tried logging into the wandb dashboard from different browsers but the problem persists.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Try to select multiple runs (on the tables page of the workspace) to add tags or to delete runs
OR
Select a single run, go to the info page, and attempt to delete the run (the confirm delete run option is greyed out for me)

**Expected behavior**
I should be able to delete a single run, or to perform actions on multiple runs on the tables page of the workspace (such as adding tags or deleting runs)
