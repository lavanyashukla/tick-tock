[CLI]: Python agent missing traceback

### Describe the bug

I'm having the same issue as in #2387, specifically for the python (not CLI) version of Wandb agent when --count=1. 

I'm using the VSCode debugger, and when an exception in my function is raised I only see something like the following (and nothing in the two log files relating to my own source code).

```
wandb: Find logs at: /tmp/wandb/wandb/run-20220425_212502-6q4aki1t/logs
wandb: ERROR Run 6q4aki1t errored: ValueError('too many values to unpack (expected 2)')
```

Stepping through the [python code](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/272ce0aed8610df9e012b4645d00bac96d90d188/wandb/agents/pyagent.py#L228), what gets printed out is `repr(exc)` not the traceback, and the exception is never re-raised. None of the other if/else blocks below this that use `self._exceptions` get entered and the code just hits a [return statement](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/272ce0aed8610df9e012b4645d00bac96d90d188/wandb/agents/pyagent.py#L261) and exits. 

Is this a bug or are you intentionally trying not to log a traceback? It makes development almost impossible when you can't see the traceback without setting a breakpoint in the Wandb codebase.

Thanks,
Collin
