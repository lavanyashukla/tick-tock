[Q] how to add files to a finished run?

BODY:
Hi, I have a run that has finished. But I later have some files to add to it. Is there any way to do it?
I've tried 
```
run.save(file_path)   # run is got from wandb.Api()
```

But this gives error `TypeError: save() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`
