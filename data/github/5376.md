[Q] How to see my used storage or saved files?

Hello,

I'm trying to clean up my saved data on Wandb and I'm struggling to find what is taking my storage space. Does there is a way to know/view the storage usage of my projects and runs with a view similar to a folder explorer?

I'm needing to do that as my storage is nearly full (99Gb /100Gb) with 56Gb of Artifact and 43Gb of other stored data. And I don't know where are those 56Gb of artifacts nor what are those 43Gb of other data.

I tried to delete all saved artifacts other than the last and best one with this code but it just saved my 12Gb of data.

My code:
```python
  import wandb
  from tqdm import tqdm
  
  
  api =  wandb.Api(timeout=31)
  runs = api.runs("user/project_name")
  
  al = []
  
  for run in runs:
      name = run.name
      artifacts = run.logged_artifacts()
      
      nb_art = len(artifacts)
      print(f"{name} has {nb_art} artifacts")
      
          
      if nb_art > 5:
          #print(f"{name} has {nb_art} artifacts")
          
          #for artifact in artifacts:
          #    al.extend(artifact.aliases)
          
          for artifact in tqdm(artifacts):
      
              if "best_k" in artifact.aliases or 'latest'  in artifact.aliases:
                  pass
              else:
                  time.sleep(2)
                  artifact.delete()

```
