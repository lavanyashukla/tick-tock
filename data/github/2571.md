TITLE:
Failed to detect the name of this notebook + The `IPython.html` package has been deprecated

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
Having 3 issues while running the following lines using jupyter notebook in the VS Code IDE:
```
import wandb
wandb.init(project='Kaggle - Amazon Forest')
```

1. Failed to detect the name of this notebook, you can set it manually with the WANDB_NOTEBOOK_NAME environment variable to enable code saving.
2. ShimWarning: `The `IPython.html` package has been deprecated since IPython 4.0. You should import from `notebook` instead. `IPython.html.widgets` has moved to `ipywidgets`.`
3. It draws a big, empty window clugging my notebook "Run(16moyzxu)" "Run not found Sorry, this run was not found."
