[CLI] `wandb.watch` causes `RuntimeError: Output 0 of BackwardHookFunctionBackward is a view and is being modified inplace.` during the forward pass

**Description**
Calling `wandb.watch` on a PyTorch model causes a `RuntimeError` during the forward pass of said model. The error seems to be related to hooks:
```
RuntimeError: Output 0 of BackwardHookFunctionBackward is a view and is being modified inplace. This view was created inside a custom Function (or because an input was returned as-is) and the autograd logic to handle view+inplace would override the custom backward associated with the custom Function, leading to incorrect gradients. This behavior is forbidden. You can remove this warning by cloning the output of the custom Function.
```

**Wandb features**
`wandb.watch` on a PyTorch model

**How to reproduce**
Running the code below reproduces the error:
```python
import wandb
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision.models import resnet18
from torchvision.datasets import FakeData
from torchvision.transforms import ToTensor


def main():
    data = FakeData(transform=ToTensor())
    dataloader = DataLoader(data)
    model = resnet18()
    wandb.init()
    wandb.watch(model)
    input, _ = next(iter(dataloader))
    model(input)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
By omitting the `wandb.watch(model)` line, there are no errors and the code executes successfully.
