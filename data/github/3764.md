[Q] Private project, public run

Hi, 

We used wandb for a research project and as part of publishing the paper we would like to make the runs we used in the paper public. However, from searching it seems like if we want to make a run public, we need to make the entire project public (including runs which are not relevant to the paper). Is this correct? Is there any way to make a single run within a private project public?

Thank you!
