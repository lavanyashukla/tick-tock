[Feature]: Improve usefullness of outlier removal for auto-scaling.

### Description

Right now, it does a reasonable job in finding a range where most data sits (using quantiles, I assume), but always drops a little bit of useful data around it. The reason the current approach fails is because if you have NO outliers, it still considers for example quatiles 5% and 95% for the auto range boundaries, which just assumes 10% of your data is outliers. This is obviously wrong, as we assumed no outliers (eg: signal is a sin(x) function).

### Suggested Solution

Use the range like it's implemented right now, and extend it by 5% or 10% in both directions. More specifically:

```py
range =   # ... the current implementation with outlier removal...
range_size = range.max - range.min
range.min -= range_size * 0.05
range.max += range_size * 0.05
```

Now consider my no-outliers example: sin(x). The current auto-range would yield -0.95 to +0.95. The length of that interval is 1.9. Add now 5% of that (which is 0.095) on both sides, and the final range becomes: -1.145 to +1.145. There you go: the sin(x) function is now nicely displayed with a little margin on the both sides.
