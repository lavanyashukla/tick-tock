No module named 'six.moves.collections_abc'

This seems to happen on google colab.
The problem is that it is ignoring the dependency requirement for six >= 1.13.0

Example:
```
%tensorflow_version 2.x
%pip install tensorflow
%pip install wandb
import six
print(six.__version__) 
```
```
...
Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.13.0 in /tensorflow-2.1.0/python3.6 (from wandb) (1.14.0)
...
Installing collected packages: smmap2, gitdb2, GitPython, sentry-sdk, graphql-core, gql, docker-pycreds, configparser, shortuuid, subprocess32, pathtools, watchdog, wandb
Successfully installed GitPython-3.0.7 configparser-4.0.2 docker-pycreds-0.4.0 gitdb2-2.0.6 gql-0.2.0 graphql-core-1.1 pathtools-0.1.2 sentry-sdk-0.14.1 shortuuid-0.5.0 smmap2-2.0.5 subprocess32-3.5.4 wandb-0.8.26 watchdog-0.10.2
1.12.0
```

and a wandb.init() results in:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'six.moves.collections_abc'
```

Similarly, if you omit the "%tensorflow_version 2.0" directive, you get:
```
ERROR: google-colab 1.0.0 has requirement six~=1.12.0, but you'll have six 1.14.0 which is incompatible.
```

So looks like six>=1.13.0 is too bleeding edge for the rest of the world.   We will likely need a new release to workaround these issues in colab.
