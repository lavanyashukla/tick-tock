TITLE:
[Feature] Allow `wandb.restore` to pull entire directories or use wildcards.

LABEL:

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
`wand.restore` is great for pulling single files from `wandb`, but there is not an obvious way to pull entire directories.

For instance, I log multiple images to my runs which are then stored in the `media/images` directory on `wandb`. I see no obvious way to copy them all to my `cwd` using `wandb.restore` apart from manually listing every literal filename in the directory.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Allow the use of wildcards or simply allow `wandb.restore` to copy entire directories.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Manually entering all desired filenames.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
