TITLE:
[App]: Web UI freezes when trying to load thousands of gradients in deep models

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Current Behavior

I notice that the browser loading time of gradients increases as a model goes deeper.
In particular, when the number of gradients is in the 1000s range, the browser starts to slow down before the gradients appear.
When in the 2000s range, the browser may freeze for minutes until the gradients display properly.
I assume that the web UI tries to load all the gradients to the browser before displaying them.

### Expected Behavior

I expect the gradient loading time to be consistent regardless of the size of the models.
Since the screen can display only 10-20 gradients at once, I expect the web UI to load them on demand to improve the loading speed.
