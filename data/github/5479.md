### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

Hi,
I'm trying to download some data on my runs using the wandb API and am getting 0 results. Normally I'd assume this is a typo somewhere, but when I re-run the same code using a debugger (pydev) and set a breakpoint on the `print(...)`, I get the expected results. From my understanding the API is synchronous, so this is a bit surprising. Below is the code snippet I used:

```python
import wandb
wandb_entity = '<redacted>'
wandb_project = '<redacted>'

api = wandb.Api()
query_response = api.runs(f'{wandb_entity}/{wandb_project}')
runs = query_response.objects
print(f'Fetched run data from wandb. Found {len(runs)} matching runs.')
```

This query should match 407 runs and due to pagination, return the first 50. With the debugger + breakpoint I get the expected outcome:
```
Connected to pydev debugger (build 231.8109.197)
Fetched run data from wandb. Found 50 matching runs.

Process finished with exit code 0
```

Without it, I get no results:
```
Fetched run data from wandb. Found 0 matching runs.

Process finished with exit code 0
```

If it's any help, below is the output of `print(vars)` for the case with no results:
