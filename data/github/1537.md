Custom Chart: Simplified gradient visualization

Hi everyone,

Once again, I'd like to say I'm a big fan of this tool, and the more I use it the more I like it. Regarding weight, bias and gradient visualization, I checked some guides and saw that using log="all" in wand.init allows you to visualize these values over time. However, in my case (and my network is not even that large), I get 224 weights and gradients to look through. This is ok, but not really viable for me since going through all 224 plots is simply not time efficient. Is there a way to visualize these values in a more wholistic way, like in a single/couple plot(s)? Please let me know if I am missing something.

Thanks.
