TITLE:
[Q] Documentation for custom sweep logic

LABEL:

BODY:
On the [Sweeps page](https://wandb.ai/site/sweeps), it says that a user can provide custom logic in a sweep, yet I couldn't quite find any documentation that allows the logic that I want to run in my sweep natively. Is there currently a way to do this in W&B?

Essentially, what I want to do is to change a config's hyperparameters based on others. For example, if a config allows a network to contain up to 4 layers and each layer is initialized with a random neuron count, but a specific run only contains 2 layers, reassign the neuron counts for the 3rd and 4th layer to be 'N/A' since they are not involved in the model construction.
