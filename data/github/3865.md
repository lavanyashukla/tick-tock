[Q] Can set a conditional statement or something when wandb sweep?

Dear All!

After configuring wandb sweep.yaml, I proceed with sweep after creating an agent
The batch size is fixed, but when it is a specific optimizer (adam), the gpu pops
So just in case, can I set a condition statement to lower the batch for a specific optimizer?
Or is there another wandb internal device?

Thank you!
