Setting history should automatically update summary

I think if I do for example

```
    run.history.add({"Train Loss": train_loss,
                     "Test Loss": test_loss,
                     "Test Accuracy": test_accuracy})
```

train_loss and test_loss and test_accuracy in summary should automatically update.

If I want a minimum train loss over the run I can calculate and set that in summary myself.
