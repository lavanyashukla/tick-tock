TITLE:
logger noise that should be debug, and not being able to turn wandb logging off

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Just rebased transformers, needed to update `wandb` and started getting this when running hf trainer:
```
2021-01-07 18:46:19 | INFO | wandb.sdk.internal.internal | Internal process exited
2021-01-07 18:46:19 | INFO | wandb.sdk.internal.internal | Internal process exited
```
1. why is this info and not debug? I can't see what useful information this adds to the user of the hosting application. Turning this to DEBUG would be awesome. thanks.

2. `export WANDB_CONSOLE=off` didn't shut it off the docs suggest https://docs.wandb.ai/library/environment-variables

3. Would it be possible to add:

`WANDB=DISABLED` env var or something like that similar to how `COMET_MODE=DISABLED` does it? which would mean don't load the module at all even if it's available and API KEY is configured.

When I work on something it makes things difficult when modules that don't participate in the development process start logging their stuff. I don't use wandb most of the time, but the fact that I have it installed keeps on running it.

Thank you very much.

For now going to uninstall wandb
