TITLE:
[Feature] Trash can for runs

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
We need to delete hundreds of runs a day. This is very common. However, the current method for deletion is extremely dangerous - it is easy to accidentally delete a _valid_ run that took 100 hours to run and $xxxx cost.

You should add a trash can that stores the runs after deletion for 30 days. This way, we can still delete runs to keep our main workspace organized, but there's no risk of serious data loss.
