TITLE:
[App] `NaN` values are ignored in graphs

LABEL:

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
Logged data points that contain a value of `NaN` are simply ignored in graphs, as if they weren't logged at all. This is misleading, and makes it easy to miss the `NaN` values.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Use `wandb.log` to log some values, where some of them are `NaN` 
2. Look at graph on website
3. No indication of `NaN` values on graph

For example, the below script logs a value of `1` every 5th step, and a value of `NaN` on any other step:

```python
import wandb
import numpy as np


def main():
    wandb.init()
    for i in range(50):
        value = np.nan if i % 5 else 1
        wandb.log(dict(value=value))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

**Expected behavior**
There should be a clear indication of logged `NaN` values.

**Screenshots**
This is the graph from the script above:

It looks like all logged values were `1`, where in fact most of the logged values were `NaN`.

**Additional context**
By looking at the CSV export, it seems like `wandb` is aware that these are `NaN` values:
