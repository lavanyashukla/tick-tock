### Description

I am trying to do hyperparameter tuning for a reinforcement learning project. I use sweep for that, I created a yalm file as suggested in the website and everything seemed to work as expected. (an ID was created, I can see the dashboard of the hyperparams etc). 

Although it seems that there is ModuleNotFoundError for every package I use in the script that is not build in python. For example I get errors for both pytorch and gym packages, which when I run locally in a virtual environment are imported correctly.

Should I in some way install these packages to wandb in some way? 

Thank you in advance.

### What I Did

`wandb agent k_ili/multiagent-particle-envs/128f6fo8`

```
 File "agent.py", line 5, in <module>
    import torch
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'
```
