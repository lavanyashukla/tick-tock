TITLE:
[App]: Offline that don't finish display incorrect runtime and status when logged

LABEL:

STATE:

### Current Behavior

Offline runs that don't finish but have results uploaded via `wandb sync` display with a duration of zero and a status of finished, despite potentially running for hours.

### Expected Behavior

Offline runs should display a runtime accurate to the last time their results were uploaded. For example, if a run will take twelve hours and five hours in the results are uploaded, it should display as having run for five hours with a status of "in progress." Once the run has finished (or otherwise stopped) and the results subsequently uploaded, the runtime should be accurate to the true value. I'm not entirely sure how the status should display or are reasonableâ€”it would depend on what kind of interrupts are actually fed to the program.

### Environment

OS:
I'm viewing results on a computer running macOS 13.1, while the actual code is running on Linux-4.18.0-372.26.1.el8_6.x86_64-x86_64-with-glibc2.28.

Browsers:
Brave 1.46.144

Version: WandB v0.13.6

### Additional Context

This is problematic because runtime is a good proxy for whether or not a run has useful information. For example, a runtime of zero seconds would likely indicate a bug and preclude logging important information about the training of a neural net. Logging a neural network that trained for hours and logged lots of information to WandB is at best inconsistent and at worst could cause the run to be deleted in the mistaken belief that it had no value was just clutter.
