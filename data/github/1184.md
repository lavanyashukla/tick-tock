### Description

I was trying to pass a numpy array with a single value to `wandb.config`,
and was surprised that it's automatically converted to a `str`.
However, I am not quite sure whether it's a bug or not, feel free to close this if it's intentional.

### What I Did

```python3
wandb.config.testing = np.array([2. ], dtype=np.float32)
print(wandb.config.testing, type(wandb.config.testing))
```
will output:
```python3
2.0 <class 'str'>
```
