TITLE:
[Q] How can i change the logging folder for sweeps?

LABEL:

BODY:
I am using WandB sweeps. For each run, I call the wandb.init() function with the argument `dir=<log_path>`. This works, the runs get saved in the desired path. However, wandb still creates a folder `./wandb` in the local directory of my script. Inside the folder, there is a subfolder called `sweep-<sweep_id>` with a config file per trial showing the hyperparemeter configuration. 

**Why is this directory created and how can i move it to the other logging path given in the init() function?**
I don't want to clutter my code.

I tried setting the environment variable

```
os.environ["WANDB_DIR"] = os.path.abspath(<log_path>)
```
at the beginning of the script, but this had no effect. I also investigated the log files. Here, I see one interesting line:

```
Loading settings from environment variables: [...] 'sweep_param_path': '<path_to_script>/wandb/sweep-ngvh9uvu/config-o04eplou.yaml'
```
So, it loads something from this undesired folder. I tried changing this env variable by calling

```
os.environ["SWEEP_PARAM_PATH"] = os.path.abspath(<log_path>)
```
without any effect. Now, I don't know what to do.
Thanks in advance!
