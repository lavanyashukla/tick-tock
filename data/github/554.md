TITLE:
wandb.log delayed

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I am running `wandb.log({"loss":loss}, step=epoch)` at the end of every epoch. However, the logs are delayed 1-2 epochs in each iteration. This means that I am seeing the logs for the first epoch only on the platform when the second or third epoch is finished. Unfortunately, after stopping the code the last epochs are then not in the logs and are missing.

Any ideas?
