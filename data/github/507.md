### Description

Currently ```Log uniform. Number between exp(min) and exp(max) so that the logarithm of the return value is uniformly distributed.```
While it should rather be distributed between min and max (keeping the meaning of the terms min and max) â€“ my expectation would have been, if I want my learning rate between 1e-8 and 1, I can just tell it to be between 1e-8 and 1, but I actually have to convert it by taking the log of my desired values, passing min: -8 and max: 0, so that I get the scaling between 1e-8 and 1. 

Solution: In the parsing of the function take the log of the min and max params.
