Description

I am running a training loop in `PyTorch` and logging values of the loss and metrics at the end of each epoch.

The way it is done in the code is:

`wandb.log({"epoch" : epoch, **train_stats})`

And the sample of the content of this dict is:

`{'epoch': 0, 'train/loss': 0.9482402317167534, 'train/IoU': 0.0004733342663286095}`

For some reason values of `train/loss` and `train/IoU` are not logged, but instead I have the following picture:

`epoch` value is logged normally:

`train/loss` and `train/IoU` are just float values. 

Whan can be the cause of this issue?
