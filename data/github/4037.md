TITLE:
[Q] Adding custom folder/files to wandb server when running RLib

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
When running wandb inside RLlib, the documentation says we need to use WandbLoggerCallback (or whatever new API) to get metrics, but since we don't define wandb.init and wandb.finish, wandb.save() is not working, and copying the folder/files we want to save to wandb_run_dir doesn't send it to the server.

Do you have any suggestions on how to do this?

Thanks!
