[Feature] Any way to only synchronize successful runs?

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Is it possible to only synchronize **successful runs** when using ```wandb sync --sync-all``` in ```offline``` mode. Generally, we have many directories like ```./wandb/offline-run-xxx```, some are successful runs who return a ```successful``` flag by wandb. However, others are failed runs due to various reasons with returning a ```failed``` flag, or even without a ```failed``` flag (e.g., the program crushed). If we use ```wandb sync --sync-all```, all runs in ```./wandb``` will be uploaded to the online interface, and it is not convenient to delete the failed runs. However, synchronize one by one is time-consuming.

So is it add a function that only automatically synchronizes successful runs?

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A possible solution is we can add a flag like ```--only-success``` to filter  out the directories with ```successful``` results.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
None

**Additional context**
If any solution already existed, could you please provide more information for it?
