[Q] turning off agents that fail runs

BODY:
Hello there, i've encountered a problem while working with a computer cluster. I created a sweep that should contain 500 runs, launched agents on different computers and later found out that one of them did 470 runs and marked all of them as failed, because the computer it was using didn't have enough CUDA memory. I know there's an option to go to wandb.ai and turn off agents manually, but is there another option where i can do it automatically? 


I tried using try/except, but python agent doesn't throw any errors, it just prints them, so i'm confused on how to deal with this.
