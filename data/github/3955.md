TITLE:
[App]: Point clouds no longer offer 3D view

### Current Behavior

Reposting from https://community.wandb.ai/t/point-clouds-no-longer-3d-viewable/2770

Point cloud view no longer offers the "X" in the upper right on mouseover to offer transition from full 3D view (e..g. rotations supported).
This used to work. But now the X is gone. 

Here's [my example](https://wandb.ai/drscotthawley/dubstep-diffgan).   Arg. LINK FAILURE: In the WandB run page, I went to the point cloud panel I wanted to share and selected “Share panel” and then “Anyone with the link can view” but it’s still not giving you a direct link to the pane. So because it’s not linking directly to the panel you’ll have to scroll through “Media” until you find “embeddings_3dpca”.

### Expected Behavior

That when mousing over an image of the point cloud, an "X" would appear in the top right of the image, which you could then click on to get a full 3D view.  This used to be the case, but is no longer appearing. 

### Steps To Reproduce

To reproduce: go to any WandB page for point cloud that used to be viewable in 3D, whether in documentation or in your own runs. You will see that there is no longer a way to make it 3D.

Try [my example](https://wandb.ai/drscotthawley/dubstep-diffgan) run, or [“3D Objects Live Example”](https://wandb.ai/nbaryd/SparseConvNet-examples_3d_segmentation/reports/Point-Clouds--Vmlldzo4ODcyMA) or [“3D Molecules”](https://wandb.ai/stacey/alphafold?workspace=user-stacey).

### Screenshots

Screenshot may not be informative because X is not appearing.  Used to be an "X" would appear in the upper right of the image when you ran the mouse over it.

Or you could expand to "full screen" and similarly an X would appear when you mouse over.
