[Q] Is it possible to turn off the http service process in offline mode?

BODY:
I am running wandb on a HPC cluster. Due to driver limitations, it is not possible to fork background processes as that may cause the entire job to crash.

Also, I am using wandb in offline mode (`WANDB_MODE=offline`) because the compute nodes do not have internet connection.

However, it still tries to launch a network service, which fails, and therefore trying to connect to it results in:

```
wandb: Tracking run with wandb version 0.13.11.dev1
wandb: W&B syncing is set to `offline` in this directory.  
wandb: Run `wandb online` or set WANDB_MODE=online to enable cloud syncing.

WARNING:urllib3.connectionpool:Retrying (Retry(total=2, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7ffcda476160>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 110] Connection timed out')': /api/5288891/envelope/
```

Is it necessary to launch the network service in offline mode, and if not, can it be turned off?
