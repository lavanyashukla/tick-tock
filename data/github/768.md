### Description

I'm using catalyst integration of wandb. When program stores info on disk it creates inside itself link to itself like :
```
| run123/
|----run123/
|----other files
```

In the result it fails to exit application normally and sent 
```ERROR Error uploading...``` 

### What I Did

```
The only way to fix this is to remove link to folder, but why it is created at first place
```
