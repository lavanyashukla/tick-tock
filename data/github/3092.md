TITLE:
[Feature] Filtering with regex

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
In the table view, I would love to quickly switch between grouping by 'Group & Job type' and seeing runs that contain the string "sweep" in their name.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great if the *filter* function would support regex. Currently, the filter function supports only binary operation (equal, in etc). However, It would be great to have a filtering option AS (e.g., 'run' as "sweep.*") to enable regex filtering on specific fields.
