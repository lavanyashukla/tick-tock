TITLE:
Overwriting old history

BODY:
Is it possible to overwrite old history with wandb. I have use-case, when my experiment diverged and I lowered learning rate and used older checkpoint to restart experiment, but wandb doesnâ€™t overwrite history and shows me this warning:
```WARNING Adding to old History rows isn't currently supported.```

I was wondering maybe there is flag to overwrite old history (didn't find in documentation)? If there is no such flag, is it possible to add this as feature request?
Thank you in advance!
