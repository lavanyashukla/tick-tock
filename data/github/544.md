### Description

When I'm sweeping a set of hyperparameters, my running agent will load the newest version of the python script. This means that if I make any edits to the python script right before the running agent finishes a run and continues to the next one, the changes won't be logged in the logs. Even worse, the run may silently do completely different behavior than what was logged.

You can test this out with the following

### What I Did
Sweep on some settings with more than one runs.
```
wandb sweep sweep.yml
wandb agent <sweep hash>
```
Now go in and edit the run script by adding `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` for example. Upon finishing the first run, the agent will start the second run with this change. The agent will then block because of the `set_trace()`.
