TITLE:
[App][CLI] wandb.ai/authorize creates team token instead of personal token

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
I have created a new personal project under `wandb.ai/<username>/<projectname>` on the website.
In the then visible setup instructions, it gives me an authorization token that is identical to the token that I get when visiting `wandb.ai/authorize`
If I log in with this token from the command line it says 'logged in as <teamname>' instead of 'logged in as <username>' 
When I start a new run, the just created project is ignored and a new project is created under `wandb.ai/<teamname>/<projectname>` and synced.
It seems like I have no way of creating a personal (non-team) login token to sync personal projects.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Be member of one team
2. Create a new personal project
3. Log in with the shown authorization token from the command line
4. Start run

**Expected behavior**
The website gives me a token that makes the CLI say 'logged in as <username>' and the CLI syncs to the just created personal project instead of creating a new team project.
