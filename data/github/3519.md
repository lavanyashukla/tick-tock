TITLE:
[CLI]: wandb does not record git diff when mode="offline"

### Describe the bug

The [offline docs](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/technical-faq#can-i-run-wandb-offline) suggest that offline mode works the same as online, but with the ability to push the results to API at a later time. However, when running with `mode="offline"`, wandb does not store the git diff as it does in online mode.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```
$ python -c "import wandb; wandb.init('foo')"
$ python -c "import wandb; wandb.init('foo', mode='offline')"
```
Then check the contents of the respective `./wandb/offline-run-*` and `./wandb/run-*` directories. Note that `./wandb/run-*/files/diff.patch` exists where as no such patch file exists in `./wandb/offline-run-*/files`.
