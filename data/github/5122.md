TITLE:
[CLI]: `Api.runs` doesn't find runs by ID

### Describe the bug

I'm unable to query runs through the `Api.runs` method by their ID (which you'd expect to be the most robust way to query for runs).

```py
import wandb

runs = wandb.Api().runs(WANDB_PATH, filters={'id': {'$in': ['1ss5gbww']}})  # this ID exists
print(f"matching runs: {len(runs)}")
>>> matching runs: 0
```
