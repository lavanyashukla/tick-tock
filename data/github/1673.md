TITLE:
Run comparer: Can't scroll down on Firefox

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
On Ubuntu 20.04 and Firefox 84.0.1. I experience that I cannot scroll-down in the Run-Comparer, as the following GIF shows.

The thing is, it works great on Google Chrome. I know that this Bug report should be rather directed at Firefox then, but I figured it would still be good to ask whether this has anything to do with the Wandb website or whether there are users experiencing similar behaviour (which might have solutions to it).

Thanks!
