TITLE:
[Feature]: Show sweep id on email for failed run

LABEL:

BODY:
### Description

WandB has great feature of sending emails when a run failed. However, it is hard to find which sweep the run was part of. Please include this in the email.

Details:
This weekend I started multiple sweeps. Now I got an email saying 'Run failed -- <run-name>'. However, how do I find out which sweep this run was part of? Could this be included in the email?

### Suggested Solution

For the auto-generated emails upon a failing run, include the sweep id

### Alternatives

An even better alternative is to include a link to the originating sweep in the info page of a run.

For example, current info can be found at `wandb.ai/<username>/<project>/runs/<run>/overview`. Why not include a link to the corresponding `wandb.ai/<username>/<project>/sweeps/<sweep>`?
