TITLE:
[Q] Setting git version information manually

LABEL:

BODY:
It would be nice to see the git version cleanly in the web UI when running from containers jobs. The catch: we usually don't copy `.git` into our images. Similarly, wandb does capture the image digest, but not the actual container name.

We have a workaround, but it is a bit unwieldy. We inject the git sha manually into our containers using docker build args and save it as an environment variable `COMMIT_SHA`. Then, we log this environment variable as `wandb.config`. The downsides is that it is a bit clunky and requires python code changes for any script.

Is there a better workaround? It would be ideal to be able to control some of these run-metadata fields using env vars. For example, wandb could listen to env variable called `WANDB_GIT_COMMIT`.
