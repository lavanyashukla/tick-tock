### Description

#### Feature Request

I'd like the ability to programmatically log some markdown for a run.  Preferably, I'd like a way to log markdown information with the run as a whole, instead of associated with a step or other x-axis unit.   Notes are only available via the UI that I can tell, but I'd like to be able to generate some notes programmatically as markdown during the run and have them saved and displayed in the info pane of the run.

### What I Did
I attempted to manually render some markdown containing the JSON definition of of my model and log it.


```python
model_markdown = f"```json\n{model.json()}\n```"
wandb.log(
{"Model Definition": wandb.Html(markdown.markdown(model_markdown))}, step=0
)
```
The HTML entry is created, but not displayed very well.   All new lines and indents from the code block are removed.

I would rather standard code block rendering like so:
```json
{
    "MLP": {
        "output_dim": 2,
        "layers": [
            {
                "Linear": {
                    "w": "shape=(10, 2)",
                    "b": "shape=(10,)",
                    "activation": "tanh"
                }
            },
            {
                "Linear": {
                    "w": "shape=(10, 10)",
                    "b": "shape=(10,)",
                    "activation": "tanh"
                }
            },
            {
                "Linear": {
                    "w": "shape=(10, 10)",
                    "b": "shape=(10,)",
                    "activation": "tanh"
                }
            },
            {
                "Linear": {
                    "w": "shape=(2, 10)",
                    "b": "shape=(2,)",
                    "activation": "identity"
                }
            }
        ],
        "input_dim": 2
    }
}
```
