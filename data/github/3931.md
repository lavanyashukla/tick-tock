TITLE:
`wandb.save` doesn't upload empty files to `wandb` server

LABEL:

STATE:
open

BODY:
As`wandb.save` doesn't uplopad the empty files to the `wandb` remote, I'd suggest you to add a warning message in case the file is empty so as to let the user know that the file won't be uploaded.

https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/a339333b3ee93864daf416f04c1501186dffac5c/wandb/sdk/wandb_run.py#L1353-L1443

To calculate the file size if it exists you can just `os.path.getsize(path)` as described in https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.getsize, which raises an `OSError` in case the file doesn't exist or is unaccesible, and the size in bytes if it succeeds, so something like:

```python
...
if os.path.getsize(glob_str) == 0:
    warnings.warn(f"File {glob_str} is empty and won't be uploaded")
    return
...
```
