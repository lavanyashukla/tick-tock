TITLE:
[Feature] Only begin logging after n steps or epoch

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
If my model fails before the first epoch I have to go and delete the run from the W&B dashboard. 

It would be great if there was an arg for only log after 1 successful epoch or n steps. Or even some clean up options on a failed run E.g if you kill the run an option asking.. "delete the log in W&B?"

Perhaps this feature is already possible in the API but I haven't been able to find it.
