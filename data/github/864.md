### Description

I logged a plotly of a correlation matrix size 36x36 and it seems to have been logged fine. The issue is when I use the browser to pin the chart. Even if the dash is empty, I receive the title error.

### What I Did

```
cols = df.columns
layout = go.Layout(yaxis = {"tickmode": "linear"}, title='Kendall Tau Feature Correlation Matrix')
fig = go.Figure(data=
                go.Heatmap(z=correlations, # a numpy matrix size 36x36
                           x=cols, # list of column names 36x1
                           y=cols,
                           ), 
                layout=layout)

wandb.log({'Kendall Tau Feature Correlation Matrix': fig})
```
