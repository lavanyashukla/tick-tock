[c:api]: wandb.Api().flush() is not working as expected

### Current Behavior
I am using the wandb api to try to do something like a custom sweep (so that I can do distributed training across machines, this is not related to the Wandb sweep, FYI), by using a run group, but I think this context is not that relevant to the issue. 

So, essentially I have the following loop - 


```
wandb_api = wandb.Api()
for idx, run in enumerate(wandb_api.runs(path = os.path.join(project_name), filters={"group": run_group_name})):
    if run.config["dist_launch_state"] == "started":
         print("some other process has started this run, hence moving to the next run")
   else:
          run.config["dist_launch_state"] == "started"
          run.update()
          do_some_stuff(run.config) here using the run's config
          run.config["dist_launch_state"] = "finished"
          run.update()
    wandb_api.flush()
```
So what I want to do is that I want to run this loop, which essentially executes the `do_some_stuff()` function, and I want to the run this loop in parallel and distributed fashion, potentially across different machines. So what I do is that I run this code snipped in parallel using say python snippet.py where `snippet.py` contains the above for loop snippet. Ideally, what should happen is when I run the jobs in parallel, say the first job has finished running `do_some_stuff()` say 10 times, and hence the `dist_launch_state` of 10 runs has been updated to finished (one of the run, i.e. the last one could be in a started dist_launch_state, i.e the 11th run could be in a started dist_launch_state since there might be some latency in me running the next python snippet.py and since the first job is continuously running it could have started the 11th run, but that is not important to this right now). 

So, now what happens is the second run of the `snippet.py` is that it correctly prints out "some other process has started this run, hence moving to the next run" 10 or 11 times (depending on the exact run states), which is completely expected since the "dist_launch_state" of the run group of those 10 or 11 runs, lets just say 10 for simplicity of notation for now, is either the string started or finished. 

But what happens after this is completely strange and unexpected, now lets say p2 (the second process which is running `snippet.py`) starts the 12th run, it starts the 12th run since the 11th run is started by p1 this runs well and fine. Now, we would expect that p1 (the first process which is running `snippet.py`) will not run the 12th run but will print  "some other process has started this run, hence moving to the next run", since p2 has started this, but this does not happen, rather it runs the 12th run also, and from this point on both the p1 and p2 run all the runs till the end of the run group - say if the run group has 100 runs, p2 will run 100 - 12 runs and p1 will run all 100 runs since it was started first obviously.

I have further tested this issue by running p3 (same notation as above), and it starts at `max(runs(p1), runs(p2))` where runs(p_i) is the number of runs run by the process p_i, and from that point on runs all the runs i.e. p3 will run 100 - max(runs(p1), runs(p2)) runs.

This is not expected at all since it is expected that the runs "see" the centralized wandb server and run only runs for whose `dist_launch_state ` keys are not `started` or  `finished`. 

I think what is happening is that only initially when the processes p1, p2, or p3 start the wandb is getting the run dist_launch_state and there after it is just using that copy of the run dist_launch_state and running the runs, despite me using the `flush()` function, which according to the api docs here - https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/public-api/api#flush - must clear the local cache and get the latest state of the runs.

PS - apologies for the long and verbose issue, but I just want to be clear in what I am saying, thanks!
