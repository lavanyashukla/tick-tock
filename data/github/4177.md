TITLE:
[App, Urgent]: Missing chart datapoints

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Current Behavior

Wandb is prunning data points from graphs, I guess to save memory and improve performance. 

Unfortunately, this seems to happen also for Validation charts, where the number of points is very small (eg 1 point every 50k steps) and this leads to missing validation datapoints. Refreshing the page seems to show different data points in the chart.

This is a super serious issue -  this prevents people from viewing the validation results reliably!





### Expected Behavior

For sparse graphs, no pruning happens and all data points are shown reliably. Eg, do not prune below 100 data points in the chart.
