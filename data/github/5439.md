TITLE:
[Q]: Configuring WandB UI to display metrics for best epoch

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
open

BODY:
By default, the WandB UI (Table) presents metric values for the last epoch of a given run. However, I would like to modify this default behavior to display metrics specifically for the best epoch. Are there any configuration options available within the UI to achieve this desired behavior?
