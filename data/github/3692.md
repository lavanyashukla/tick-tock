TITLE:
[App]: Range selector doesn't work on grouped runs on web app

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
### Current Behavior

The range selector to switch between Min/Max, Std Dev, Std Err and  Sampels in grouped bar plots doesn't work on my project. We are using pykeen, a library to train models on knowledge graphs, and it logs a lot of metrics, so we end up with 450 charts on the  web interface. The bar plots initially worked without issues, but soon after we started using grouped runs to run models with different random seeds, the range selector would get stuck on Min/Max. The UI of the selector would change, but the change wouldn't be reflected in the plot. The first change in a new plot takes effect, but after that the selector has no effect and the plot always displays the Min/Max.

### Expected Behavior

Range selector working on grouped runs on bar plot, showing std dev and std err. 

### Steps To Reproduce

1.  Launch multiple grouped runs using pykeen (the issue might be more general)
2. Select the chart for one or more metrics, like hits@10
3. Toggle multiple changes with the Range selector in the grouping menu of the bar plot 
4. Close and reopen the chart, toggle more changes with the Range selector in the grouping menu of the bar plot
