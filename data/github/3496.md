TITLE:
[App]: Missing characters in search bar for large workspace

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Current Behavior

When filtering runs in the workspace search bar, e.g. when trying to type the following regex "32batch.*1024dim" the workspace constantly reloads during typing. However this reload appears to be synchronous, and characters typed during the reload are lost, which is problematic for a large workspace. So for example I may type up to "32ba" then the workspace starts reloading, I continue typing but while it reloads the remaining characters are lost. Once I have finished typing and once the workspace is done loading the search bar only contains "32ba". Now I need to go back and retype the next few characters until it happens again, which is very annoying.

### Expected Behavior

They should happen asynchronously so that I can continue typing in the search bar even while the runs load.

### Steps To Reproduce

Make a large workspace with lots of runs containing lots of plots. Then try using the search bar to type a long ish regex pattern.
