[CLI]: Wandb [occasionally] fails to shut down sender and handler

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

I am running a multi-day wandb job on a slurm cluster that requires me every couple of hours to create a new job and resume training from wherever the previous job left off. Currently, I restart a new job by sending a SIGINT signal (every several hours) to my main program which handles this signal by saving a checkpoint to wandb, and launching a new job with the info required to resume training from where it left off. Most of the time this works great, but occasionally wandb will hang when it receives the exit code. The times when it fails, wandb will push up all the files in the current wandb run before exiting, but then will continue to handle keepalive requests, instead of shutting down the sender and handlers. 

I am attaching two sets of debug-internal and debug logs - both were generated by the same run but one comes from an earlier point in training (when wandb correctly handles shutting down and launching a new job) while the other comes from a later point in training (run on a different slurm node) when wandb fails to exit correctly.
