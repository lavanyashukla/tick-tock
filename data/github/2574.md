TITLE:
Sweep: different seed in every run for bayesian search of hyperparams [Q]

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
In my code, I run each experiment with a random seed generated from random.choice(range(n)). Does having different seed for each run affect the hyperparameter search using bayesian searching technique? Should I be using the same seed across all the runs created by the sweep?
