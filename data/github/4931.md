### Description

first of all, thanks for the great tool; I love using W&B. 

Feature:
It would be great if we could filter runs by a linked report. This way, at the end of a larger project, we could select all unused experiments and remove them. 

### Suggested Solution

Part I: Link the runs to reports
If I know well, the reports are not linked to the runs. I think it would be beneficial if the runs contained links to the reports. Thus the user could jump directly to reports where a specific run appears and gather more contextual information from different reports. 

Part II: Filtering by reports
In the run table, it would be great to filter by reports. We should be able to select multiple reports and show only the runs appearing in those. 

### Alternatives

Part I: Simple flag for the runs
A simplified feature for the described use case could be just to have a single flag stored for the runs, which tells whether the specific run is used in a report or not. 

Part II: Simple filtering
In the run table, we should be able to select all the runs that were not used in any reports. 

### Additional Context

During my research, I came to a use case that might be worth implementing a feature for it. I run many experiments and collect the most insightful ones into reports. However, it is getting tedious to remove the unnecessary ones.
