Binary sklearn LogisticRegression and feature importance

Hi wandb team,

I am trying to plot the feature importance of a LogisticRegression model for binary classification problem. Then 
`model.coef_.shape == (1, n_features)`
and this check fails :
https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/63a5dd08e72fc20d3fe0eb5d441843870b0ed7f5/wandb/sklearn/__init__.py#L646
(unless we have n_features == 1)

I believe we should (at least) squeeze `importance` before the check and not have the else branch?
