TITLE:
[Q] How to use API to edit `job_type`? 

LABEL:

BODY:
Using a script similar to the one below, I can edit group names, but not job types. I also see that `job_type` is not listed in the [`wandb.Run` API](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/run). Is it possible with the API, and if so, how? 
```
api = wandb.Api()
runs = api.runs(path="{}/{}".format(wandb_username, project_name))

for run in runs:
    run.job_type = new_job
    run.update()
```
