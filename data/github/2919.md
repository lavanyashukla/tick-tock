TITLE:
[App] wandb sync for offline runs doesn't upload all data until run is finished.

Hi,

I've been using the `wandb sync` to upload offline runs lately, using `os.environ['WANDB_MODE'] = 'dryrun'`.
Somehow, if the run isn't completed, all of my arguments (uploaded with `wandb.config.update(args)`) won't appear till the end of the run.
A similar behaviour is happening when I upload metrics: they appear in the figures, but the data only appears in the table at the end of the run.

Let me know if you need more information about my setup and/or code.

Thanks!
