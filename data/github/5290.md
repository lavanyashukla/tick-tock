### Current Behavior

I am grouping my runs based on a number of flags.  Sometimes I want to change the group ordering, e.g. from first group by Flag1 then by Flag2, to first group by Fl. 1 then by Fl. 2. Other times I want to insert a new flag, between Flags 1 and two.

Currently, there seems to be a "drag and drop" feature, but that feature is rarely working as expected. Only once, by some magic, I managed to pull the current last flag to the front.

I am running Ubuntu Linux. I have tried both Firefox and Chrome. To be on the safe side, I also tried reordering from the my Android (Chrome again) but to no success.

### Expected Behavior

Being able to reorder group variables.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create several runs with several different flags.
2. Group by some of those flags, using the Group menu (the one next to filter)
3. In the Group menu try to reorder the flags.
