Here's the debbug log
[debug (1).log](https://github.com/wandb/client/files/3612330/debug.1.log)

One potential weirdness is that I saw it trying to upload data to someone else's account
```
https://app.wandb.ai/sokolov-yas/Transformer-XL+source+code/runs/bbecxm7m
```

This is an account of of a person who created an image I'm running. Does `wandb login` save credentials to disk?
