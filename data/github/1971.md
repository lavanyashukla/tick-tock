TITLE:
[Q] Error trace with Sweeps

BODY:
I was wondering were we can obtain the error trace of the internal model with hyperoptim sweeps.

Right now all I get in logs and stdout is:
```
Run axtblwew errored: TypeError("'float' object is not subscriptable")
wandb: ERROR Run axtblwew errored: TypeError("'float' object is not subscriptable")
```

A line number or ideally a error backtrace would go a long way towards debugging complex models/configs.
