TITLE:
Add Native Support for Fastai Tensor Types

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
[fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) extends PyTorch's tensors to have custom data types like `TensorCategory`, etc. I'm not sure how exactly the WandbCallback for fastai works but I assume it converts them to PyTorch tensors when passing it to Wandb's JSONEncoders.

Do you think it makes sense to add native support for this? It would require modifying `wandb/util.py` like so:
```python
def is_fastai_tensor_typename(typename):
    # restrict to TensorCategory and TensorMultiCategory?
    return typename.startswith('fastai') and 'Tensor' in typename

def json_friendly(obj):
    ...
    elif is_pytorch_tensor_typename(typename) or is_fastai_tensor_typename(typename):
    ...
```
