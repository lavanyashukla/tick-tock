### Description
I'm using wandb with an existing codebase that uses tensorflow. The code saves gif summaries through a `tf.summary.FileWriter`. Judging by [this line](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/6417dd926abe76dbb7c56e7017d2ee7d1c918eb5/wandb/tensorboard/__init__.py#L226) in the wandb code this should be supported by wandb. However, `add_summary` fails with the following error (if the gif summary has tag `some/tag/animation/gif`):
```
wandb: ERROR Unable to log event [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '[...]/wandb/dryrun-20190924_104624-jhkwznfx/media/videos/train/some_tag_animation_gif_0_0.gif'
```
