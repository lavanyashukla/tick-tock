tl;dr: how to add your image in a HTML logging step ?

I am currently loggings multiple images on wandb.

What I am currently doing, is concatenating them across the different axis, reshaping them, adding margins and sections manually, etc.

This is tedious work, and I would like to simplify this. One solution would be to log a table, but currently, you cannot add lines in an iterative fashion while visualizing it on wandb.

I was looking into HTML logging, where I would be able to log an HTML page with my images arranged as I want.
To do so, I need to provide in an HTML a link to my image, I was wondering how to do that in wandb?

The link should look like `https://wandb.ai/user/project/groups/runname/files/media/images/.../images_13224_23432432789.png`
but how can i obtain this path/do it?
