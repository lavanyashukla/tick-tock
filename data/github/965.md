[Enhancement] CatBoost support in W&B

* Python version: Python 3.7.2
* Operating System: MacOS Sierra

### Description

I have successfully implemented W&B to capture parameters and save and upload my models to the cloud.

Although there is no callbacks support (via a named param) in [Catboost](https://catboost.ai/docs/).

If it's trivial i'm happy to implement it for you if you can show me an example or point me to how you would this when no callbacks support is available. 

Is there a custom `WandBCallback` implementation that can be adapted to work with Catboost?

### What I Did

I looked on their GitHub repo and found this [one conversation](https://github.com/catboost/catboost/issues/147). And other [such conversations](https://github.com/catboost/catboost/issues?q=is%3Aissue+callback+is%3Aclosed) as well. They talk about reading their debug logs or other log files written out during the training process.
