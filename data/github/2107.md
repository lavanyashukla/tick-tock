[Q] Is it possible to change the location where the cache folder is created?

Hi, 
Currently the default cache folder is created for me in a directory with space limitations imposed by my organization, so my runs are failing when I try to use large artifacts. Is there a way to relocate the cache to a different directory?
Thanks!
