TITLE:
File download should not auto-open as text file

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Right now, the file download API automatically opens the downloaded file in read-only mode (see [here](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/eb8dd5c56d88454d443102d871d81cc6b5992f52/wandb/apis/public.py#L1202)). It would be better to return the filename (instead of opening a potentially unnecessary file descriptor) or to at least allow the user to specify the open mode (e.g. if I have saved a model file, I should be able to open it in read-binary mode).
