[Q] Is it possible to plot metrics where epochs is on the x-axis ( Training in mmDetection)?

Thanks for the awesome tool!!

I am training multiple models each with a different training dataset size. I want to evaluate each model's performance . At the moment I seem only to be able to plot step (iteration) on the x-axis. This is not ideal as the smaller datasets would train for fewer steps, see the screenshot below. 

(This is due to the following formula `num_itterations = (num_epochs*num_imgs_in_dataset)/batch_size`. With the num_epochs and batch size remaining constant while the number of imgs in the dataset decreases, the number of iterations therefore decreasea)

I am using mmDetection and have not found a way to log the metrics per epoch and plot them in the Wandb UI. 

Any help would be much appreciated.
