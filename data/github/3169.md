The scrolling for a markdown panel works in default view however there is no scrolling for full screen view.

It only happens on my desktop while viewing on laptop does allow scrolling. 
Desktop viewing details:
screen resolution: 2560x1440 pixels. The aspect ratio is 16:9.
browser's inner resolution: 2560x1247 pixels

Pls fix
