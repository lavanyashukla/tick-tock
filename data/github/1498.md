TITLE:
wandb loads a very outdated `prompt_toolkit` - breaks other ipython modules

LABEL:
stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Currently `wandb` supplies a very outdated `prompt_toolkit` ver 1.0.15 (current is 3.0.8) and messes up with `sys.path` in `util.vendor_setup` by adding `wandb/vendor/` to it. And pushing it first :(

This results in:

```
python -c "import wandb, ipyexperiments"
/home/stas/anaconda3/envs/main-38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/vendor
/home/stas/anaconda3/envs/main-38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/vendor/gql-0.2.0
/home/stas/anaconda3/envs/main-38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/vendor/graphql-core-1.1

I recommend:
1. please remove 'prompt_toolkit` from your source code - there is dependencies for that. there is no way you will be remembering to keep it up-to-date and the user may have a need to use a different version anyway - so please don't take control away from the user.
2. if you have to mess with `sys.path`, please consider adding those additional paths at the end of it, and not via:
```
            sys.path.insert(1, p)
```
this is probably the easiest quick fix - but perhaps it'd help to edit `sys.path` just for the duration of loading these specific packages and then restoring it back to normal?

currently you push in front of it:
```
/home/stas/anaconda3/envs/main-38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/vendor
/home/stas/anaconda3/envs/main-38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/vendor/gql-0.2.0
/home/stas/anaconda3/envs/main-38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/vendor/graphql-core-1.1
```
again, if you need those please consider using dependencies. I see you're using some really old versions of those libraries, so this is just a recipe for a conflict.

If you have to use those specific versions please change your API for a user to explicitly load any of these vendor libraries and do not load those automatically on `import wandb` -  or change `sys.path` - if some module chooses to `import wandb` it shouldn't negatively impact the rest of the system. I hope this is a reasonable request.

why do I have this issue in first place? Since I tried to use an `ipython` software along with `transformers`, and since the latter loads `wandb`, well:

```
python -c "import transformers, ipyexperiments"
``` 
fails identically as `import wandb, ipyexperiments`

Currently I use on of the following workarounds:
1. remove `wandb`
2. load `ipykernel` first `python -c "import ipykernel, wandb, ipyexperiments"` which gets the right  `prompt_toolkit` 
3. load `wandb` or `transformers` last:  `python -c "import ipykernel, wandb, ipyexperiments"` - same effect  as (2)
4. funnily enough installing `comet_ml` solved this too since `transformers` loads it before `wandb` and `comet_ml` loads `ipykernel` first - same effect as (2)

Thank you!
