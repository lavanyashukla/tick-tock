TITLE:
[Q] How to get rid of the `ResourceWarning` warning?

BODY:
Hi, thank you for providing such an excellent project to conveniently log my experiments.
However, I have encountered an issue. I found that once I installed wandb (even not import it yet), my running exps will raise many many warnings like this 
> tempfile.py:860: ResourceWarning: Implicitly cleaning up <TemporaryDirectory '/tmp/tmpp1tj0s33wandb-media'>

which are quite bothersome.
I 've tried various solutions like directly suppressing warnings, but none of them works.
I was wondering if you could provide me with any assistance or ideas on how to resolve this issue?
Thanks!
