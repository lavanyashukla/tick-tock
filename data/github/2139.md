TITLE:
Ability to control default font (size) in UI and line thickness [Feature]

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I have difficulty reading the text on the wandb UI and find the lines hard to see. The default font is just too small for me. Zooming in on a plot does not increase the font size or line thickness, it just uses more space but does not help readability.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I am looking for the ability to control the default font size so that the plots are readable when I open a link, without having to take additional corrective action.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I have tried zooming with the browser, but this does not increase line thickness and makes the display difficult to use with many plots. It also requires taking action for each link opened. 

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
