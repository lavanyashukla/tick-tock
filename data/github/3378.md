[Q] step slider for history data

Hi,
Is it possible to create a step slider when working with `history` data? The example here https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/app/features/custom-charts#how-to-show-a-step-slider-in-a-custom-chart shows this feature for `historyTable` only, and it seems that the same procedure doesn't work for `history` data.  This is my use-case: I'm running a hyperparam sweep and logging data via `wandb.keras.WandbCallback()`. Now, I would like to create a custom chart with `loss` and `val_loss` (as X and Y axes). I do this by fetching the data with this query:

This query creates a scatter plot of the `loss`-`val_loss`, but with all epochs dumped in the same graph. 
Now, I would like to split that by adding a third dimension (i.e. `_step` or `epoch` dimension) and get the epoch slider so I can have a chart that shows `loss` - `val_loss` graph for each epoch/step separately.
