TITLE:
[Feature]: Add xyz format to Media Logging

### Description

Thanks for building the capability to log molecular data: the formats so far are great, but seem to be mostly focused on large biomolecular structures. It would super super useful if a [generic format like xyz ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format) would be supported. It's extremely widely used + simple. 

### Suggested Solution

Add new type to the Molecule class in `wandb/sdk/data_types.py`
