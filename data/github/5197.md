TITLE:
[Feature]: Restore scheduling of deleted runs from grid search

### Description

When performing a grid search, sometimes I have to delete some runs due to crashes. However, once deleted, that specific hyperparameters configuration is not scheduled again. 
The only solution that I found is to create a new identical sweep importing the successful runs, and let the missing one be scheduled again.

### Suggested Solution

Re-run all of the deleted runs until the sweep is completed. This used to be the case in previous version of wandb, and it would avoid the hustle of creating new sweeps from the successful runs in order to re-schedule the missing ones.
