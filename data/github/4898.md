TITLE:
[CLI]: wand.save() does not accept pathlib.Path

### Describe the bug

This is contrary to how most python libraries work. For instance, it is perfectly fine to pass a `pathlib.Path` to
* `open()`
* `torch.save()`
* `numpy.save()`
* `xarray.to_netcdf()`
To give just a few examples. Explicitly requiring a string is unexpected and counter-intuitive.
