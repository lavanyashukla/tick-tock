### Current Behavior

When importing a ROC panel into a report, all ROC panels are listed as 'Vega2', making it difficult to find the desired one.

### Expected Behavior

ROC panels should be listed as their panel title, like other charts.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Create a ROC plot
2. Create/edit a report
3. Go to any section and click on 'import panel'

### Screenshots

_No response_

### Environment

OS: Windows 10

Browsers: Chrome

Version: 100.0.4896.88


### Additional Context

This is a minor nitpick, but the ROC plot uses the 'Area under curve' Custom Chart which is, in this instance, inappropriately named.
