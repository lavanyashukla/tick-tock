TITLE:
[Feature]: Handle SIGTERM in sweep agent

LABEL:

BODY:
### Description

We run W&B sweeps on Kubernetes using AWS Spot instances. When these are about to be terminated by AWS, the AWS Node Termination Handler will drain the affected node, signalling to all running pods on that node to terminate gracefully using the SIGTERM signal.

Our training script handles this signal by stopping training, saving a checkpoint, finishing up logging to W&B and exiting. However, when training is run as part of a sweep, our training script doesn't receive the signal, because the W&B sweep agent doesn't handle or forward it.

Looking through the [source code](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/b67be917facb1ccac993a7898c72c00cb8a6aad9/wandb/wandb_agent.py#L259) is seems the agent handles `KeyboardInterrupt`, which is the SIGINT signal, but not SIGTERM.

Would love to see this added.

### Suggested Solution

Register a signal handler for SIGTERM which terminates runs by also sending the terminate signal.

### Alternatives
