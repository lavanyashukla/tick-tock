Getting link run page in console output

BODY:
It would be useful to display link to the run when wandb finishes.

I'm trying to match the run in the dashboard to what I have in my console history, and all I have to go on is this 
```
wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish, PID 37939
wandb: Program ended successfully.
wandb: You can sync this run to the cloud by running: 
wandb: wandb sync wandb/run-20190607_153421-jhgjl15c
```
