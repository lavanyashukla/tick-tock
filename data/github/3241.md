TITLE:
[App]: Visualizing some plots hides the previous ones when using grouping.

### Current Behavior

When visualizing grouped runs, adding a run hides the previously visualized runs. In the attached screenshots, adding 'default' or any runs above it hides the bottom 4 runs. But 'default' and other runs in the 4 groups above it can be visualized together.

### Expected Behavior

_No response_

### Steps To Reproduce

Unsure. This does not happen with all runs and nor does it have to do with the number (I can visualize >5 other groups)
