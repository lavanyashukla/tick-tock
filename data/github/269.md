### Description

Sometimes wandb gets stuck when syncing files after a script exits. This doesn't seem to be a connection or server-side problem since waiting doesn't help but instead restarting and immediately exiting again usually works.

The stuck processes can become a real problem when running in a scheduled cluster context where it can block resources for days if it is not manually resolved.

I have no idea why the upload gets stuck but as a first measure adding an (optional) timeout would at least resolve the resource blockage issue.
