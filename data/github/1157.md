TITLE:
UI makes it impossible to edit 1-line markdown cells without resizing

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Problem related to the *reports'* UI.

### Description

How to reproduce:
 - Create a report
 - Add a markdown cell
 - Resize it to be 1 line tall
 - Try to edit the text

Expected behaviour: clicking the cell should open the editor and allow the user to type on the cell

Observed behaviour: when hovering on the cell the clickable text appears ("_Add images by dragging & dropping or pasting, use $math$ for TeX_") making it impossible to click on the cell and edit the content.
