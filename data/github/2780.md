TITLE:
[Feature] Better Line Colours in Line Series Plots

LABEL:

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

I'm trying to plot the metric of different datasets in the same plot. I've got the code figured out, and I've plotted it, but it is very difficult to make sense of the plot. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**

1. Plot all of them with different colors, like how the plots are shown when the y-axis contains multiple items.
2. Give an option to change the line styles and colors.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

Plotting each dataset's metrics separately, and then manually combining them by making the y-axis of one of them take all other datasets.

Unfortunately this is not scalable, since I have > 50 plots like this and expect to have more in the future.
