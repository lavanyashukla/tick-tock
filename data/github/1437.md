TITLE:
Unexpected behavior when discarding draft edits to report

LABEL:
bug,c:reports,stale

STATE:

BODY:
When I start to edit a report, and thus create a "draft" with my WIP edits, then I discard the draft, the following unexpected behavior occurs:

1. the report URL is modified (the report ID at the end of the URL, specifically) -- this breaks any links I have shared to the report previously, even though the report content is unchanged
2. I am redirected to the project folder, not to the published copy of the draft, and going "back" in my browser doesn't bring me to the report, since the URL is changed (going "back" ends up redirecting me to `https://<wandb>/<team>/<project>/reportlist#404`, where I need to search or scroll through to find the original report)

Item 1 seems to me like a bug, since my drafts should not affect the main report unless I hit "save to report" (why is it a "draft" otherwise?)

Item 2 seems like poor user experience, regardless of item 1!
