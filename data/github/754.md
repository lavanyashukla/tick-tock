Wandb across multiple notebooks

### Description

I am trying to use the wandb.log function across multiple notebooks. I have already [modified](https://medium.com/@ryanwalden/how-to-use-papermill-in-google-colab-9f83df1dcb70) my Google Colab notebooks such that they will work with papermill and scrapbook. 

### What I Did
The way that seemed clearest to do this was to initialize a wandb session with `resume=True` (let's call this Notebook 1 ) then call another notebook (Notebook 2) with papermill from Notebook 1, and parameterize it to initialize a wandb session with the same project name. This results instead in creating another run folder in the wandb directory with a similar name:

`run-20200110_185809-6dfv5i6p`
`run-20200110_185900-6dfv5i6p`
 
I also saw the documentation for grouping in wandb but I'd rather keep all notebooks I call with papermill reporting to the same run.

Notebook 1 Initialization and Papermill:
```
session = wandb.init(project="p_name", entity="company", name="ABC, magic=True, resume=True)
parameters = {}
parameters['project_name'] = session.name

output_nb = pm.execute_notebook(
        input_path = "Notebook 2.ipynb",
        output_path = "Notebook 2 Out.ipynb", 
        parameters = parameters
    )
```

Notebook 2 Initialization:
```
project_name = None # this will be updated by the papermill parameters
wandb.init(project=project_name, resume=True)
```
