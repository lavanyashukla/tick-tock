TITLE:
[Feature] Remove or rename group name

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Grouping runs inside one project is a very good way to structure model training or experiments overview.
But group names at first are not always good ones.
In many cases, I'd like to rename the group or even delete it (keep runs, but without a specific group).

What I suggest to add
- API to change or delete group name
- UI on wandb.ai to change or delete group name

For now, I found a way to change the group name:
```python
api = Api()
run = api.run(run_name)
run.group = new_group_name
run.update()
```
But this doesn't work for removing group names:
```python
run.group = None
run.update()
```
does nothing.
