TITLE:
Launch sweeps and agents using API [Feature] 

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I currently use a bash script to launch `wandb` sweeps and associated agents:
```bash
wandb_output=$(wandb sweep --name "$name" "$config" 2> >(tee >(cat 1>&2)))
id=$(echo $wandb_output | tail -n1 | awk 'END {print $NF}')

echo "Creating $nruns sessions..."

for i in $(seq $gpu0 $(($gpu0 + $nruns-1))); do
  gpu=$(($i % $ngpu));
  echo "tmux at -t $session$i"
  tmux new-session -d -s "$session$i" "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$gpu wandb agent $id"
done
```
Parsing strings with bash is awkward and prone to error. I would like to rewrite my script in python using the `wandb` API. In the documentation, I see options for querying runs and sweeps and for creating an individual run, but not for creating a sweep or spawning agents for an existing sweep. 

Ideally I would like two methods: `create_sweep` and `launch_agent` or something to that effect. Please let me know if there is a good way to do this with existing `wandb` features.
