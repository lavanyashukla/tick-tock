**Describe the bug**
Hello, reporting a bug here. It seems that in the newer version of the wandb client, I could no longer use the relative time as the x-axis.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Here is a notebook that reproduces it: 


1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EBk2UU91dBrtcEGk790Cidp1FPGopX-p?usp=sharing
2. Run the notebook
3. Head to the generated run such as https://wandb.ai/wandb/cartpole_test/runs/iwpuk8m0?workspace=user-costa-huang
4. Play with any metircs by trying to change it x-axis to relative time
5. See the bug that you can't do that

**Expected behavior**
It was working in 0.9.*. For example, it works [here](https://wandb.ai/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/runs/37cf7g9t/overview?workspace=)
