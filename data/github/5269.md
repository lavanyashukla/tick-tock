TITLE:
[Feature]: In Tables UI, add option to make column names wrap around

### Description

Hello, the column names in the Tables UI are automatically cut off. When manually resizing them (which also takes a lot of time), a lot of whitespace is needed to see the entire column, if the name is a bit longer.

### Suggested Solution

It would be amazing if we could have the option to wrap around the column names (or alternatively automatically adjust the width to the name).

Thank you!
