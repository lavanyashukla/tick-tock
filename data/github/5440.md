[CLI]: wandb.init very slow

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

I love wandb generally. The experience is great. Except the Python client has been very slow. 

I'm able to reproduce the results below locally on a Mac M1 and remotely on an AWS machine with a very fast connection.

1. `import wandb` on its own takes about one second. This is really high! Perhaps there's room to do some lazy importing. 
2. `wandb.init` takes several seconds, ranging from 2 seconds up to 10 seconds. The docs say that it's launching a secondary process for logging so it's surprising to me that it takes more than a few milliseconds before returning to the user. I'd guess that the remainder of process setup can happen asynchronously in that secondary process.

Hope this is useful and I'd love to have the client library be faster!! The current slow startup means that I have extra configuration effort to decide whether I'm doing fast iteration work (where wandb must be off!) or big run work (where I definitely want wandb). I'd love to just use wandb for all my runs!
