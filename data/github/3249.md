TITLE:
[CLI] No config file in offline mode

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
No config file seems to be created when offline mode is selected. This prevents grouping and identification of runs when they are then manually synced to the server.

**Wandb features**
When the init function is called as `wand.init(mode='offline',...)`, the metrics seem to be correctly logged, but, under the run directory, the `files/` subdirectory will contain no `config.yaml` file, preventing correct logging of configuration.

**Environment**
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.3
- Python Version: [eg. 3.8.10]
