**Describe the bug**

I'm running `wandb` with `os.environ["WANDB_SILENT"] = "true"` but I'm still seeing this output; 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1019791/100547177-8f2b5700-3265-11eb-9310-477bcfac341c.png)

There's a lot less output with the environment variable set this way. But I wouldn't call it silent. Is it possible to turn this off too or is this a bug? 

This was run on python3.7 with wandb version '0.10.11'.
