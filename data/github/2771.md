[Q] Clarification on the implementation of hyperband algorithm in Sweeps

Hello,

I was reading the [documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/configuration#hyperband) about the Hyperband algorithm in Sweeps. In the original paper, each bracket refers to an implementation of Successive Halving Algorithm (SHA). However, in the documentation, it says that a bracket is one pre-set iteration counts. I am confused what the iteration is referring to and how the Hyperband works in sweeps.

In the cases where I have `max_iter=150`, `eta=3`, and `s=4`, the early stopping will occur based on the epochs [150/3, 150/9, 150/27, 150/81] and the thresholds calculated based on these epochs, as seen in the [source code](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/sweeps/hyperband_stopping.py#L186-L195).

My question is that when I looked at the code, I find SHA is applied only once rather than multiple times. How is SHA implemented in the W&B version of Hyperband?

Also, is the hyperband implemented serially or parallelly? 
If serial and the history of different runs are necessary to decide early stopping, does it mean that the first run will never be pruned?
And if it is parallel such that every run is ran for a set epoch and then compared, how does this fit with Bayesian Gaussian processes which require the hyperparameters in each run to be sampled from previous run results?

Thank you.
