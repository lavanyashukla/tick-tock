TITLE:
[CLI] Tensorboard integration bug with resetting x-axis through global_step

**Description**

When using the tensorboard integration, the latest version `wandb==0.10.23` does not seem to handle `global_step` properly when it was reset to 0, whereas the older version of `wandb==0.9.5` seems to have recorded correctly. 

Consider a simple code sample:

```python
import numpy as np
import random
import time
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
import wandb

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # setup the environment
    experiment_name = f"wandb=={wandb.__version__}__{int(time.time())}"
    run = wandb.init(project="cleanRL", entity=None, 
                     sync_tensorboard=True, name=experiment_name, 
                     save_code=True,)
    writer = SummaryWriter(f"runs/{experiment_name}")
    for global_step in range(100):
        writer.add_scalar("loss1", np.random.rand(1)[0], global_step)
    for global_step in range(100):
        writer.add_scalar("loss2", np.random.rand(1)[0], global_step)
```

In particular, notice that the loss2 is recorded when the `global_step` has been reset. When visualizing, it shows like this:

If we visualize the loss using `global_step` as the x-axis, the runs recorded with `wandb==0.10.23` seem to break while `wandb==0.9.5` seems to work correctly. Also the [tensorboard page](https://wandb.ai/costa-huang/cleanRL/runs/3b4feosq/tensorboard?workspace=user-costa-huang) for `wandb==0.10.23` also displays correctly.

`global_step` in tensorboard is a way to customize the x-axis and quite helpful. Without it, it would look like the following two cases if I did anything with tensorboard:

Neither is desirable (the first image has a bug while the second does not align the x-axis).

Hope this is helpful :)
