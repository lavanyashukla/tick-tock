TITLE:
[CLI] Code and weights not getting saved on the wandboard.

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I have been trying to save the code and the model weights on my project wandboard. They used to work a few months ago but have stopped. (I guess since I upgraded to the patched version mentioned [here](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1972#issuecomment-801609626)) but it didn't work.

I have been using:
```
wandb.init(project=project, entity=entity, sync_tensorboard=True, config=vars(args),
            name=experiment_name,save_code=True, dir=wandb_save_dir, **kwargs)
```
I tried adding `os.environ['WANDB_SAVE_CODE'] = "true"` as mentioned in  [here](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1248#issuecomment-696933966) #1248 

With regards to the weights, they are not getting synced with wandboard for some reason even when the weights are present in the `wandb` folder. For that matter, even the `config.yaml`, `diff.patch`, `requirements.txt`, `wandb-metadata.json`, `wandb-summary.json`, etc. files are not getting synced.

**Environment**
- OS: Mac OS Mojave
- Python Version: 3.6.10
- Wandb version: 0.10.25
