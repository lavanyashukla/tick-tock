### Description

Thanks to the *wandb.Image* class, we are able to log segmentation mask during training. This tool is amazing. It can be better if we can display pixels which have a confidence superior at a score settable in the UI (like the bouding box logger with the param *score*).


### Suggested Solution

I you consider this feature, the coder has to send an array of floating numbers (lie in interval [0,1] and represent the score prediction for every pixels) and a slider will be displayed in the UI to set the minimum of confidence for each pixel on the mask.
It can maybe replace the opacity slider, which is, from me, not useful. 

### Alternatives

I have not alternative for this feature, say me if you have one. I will be pleased to implement it in my code. 

### Additional Context

Thank you for your answers. WandB is an amazing tool !
