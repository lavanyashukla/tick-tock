TITLE:
[CLI]: Failed sweep runs stay alive, cannot delete them from the web application

### Describe the bug

Sometimes I start sweeps only to notice that there is still a bug in my implementation, causing some runs to fail. Previously I would simply delete them from the wandb sweep interface, fix the bug, and then restart the client on my computing infrastructure. These runs typically stay active for a very long time, even after having crashed (right now, >10 minutes and still alive). Recently however, some new web-app feature was introduced, disallowing me to delete these runs:

This is really annoying since I cannot redo these runs and have to start a completely new sweep. Could we revert to the state where active runs are deletable? Or is there some workaround?

Thanks!
