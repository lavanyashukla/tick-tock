TITLE:
[Q] Marker not displayed properly in the legends of downloaded panel images

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
After downloading a panel in png, svg, png format, or exporting a report in latex format, the resulting marker in the chart's legend appears as a hollow square. I have also tried to change the line styles but the results are the same. How can I get the same image as on the web page? thanks!
