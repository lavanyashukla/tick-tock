TITLE:
Local wandb not letting me add back user I have deleted

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
`wandb --version && python --version && uname`

* Python version: 3.6.9
* Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)

### Description

I have some trouble adding users in the local version of wandb (i.e. wandb local). It seems that it is not letting me re-add a user that I have deleted from the system. It tells me that their email address still exists in the system, even after I have deleted them.

### What I Did
1. I tried adding a user via email address at http://localhost:8080/admin/users. 
2. That particular user didn't get an email, so I thought of deleting the user and adding him back. So I deleted the user  at http://localhost:8080/admin/users. 
3. When I tried adding the user again (like in step 1), I saw the error "Email is already in use."

Thank you for your help in advance!
