TITLE:
Resuming distributed runs?

LABEL:

BODY:
Right now I'm doing something like this
```
    wandb.init(project="transformer-xl", name=f'one_machine-{os.environ["RANK"]}', group='my-run')
```

When one of the machines gets pre-empted, all processes are killed and then restarted from earlier checkpoint. 

What's the recommended way of resuming this run?
