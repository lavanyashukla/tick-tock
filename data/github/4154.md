[Q] Is there a way to change the legend for all plots?

Hi,

Currently the only way I know how to change a legend is to click the edit button on an individual plot and then enter a custom legend such as:

```
 [[ ${x}: ${y} ]] train:${config:epoch_loop.rllib_config.train_batch_size} sgd:${config:epoch_loop.rllib_config.sgd_minibatch_size}
```

If I want to apply this legend to multiple plots, I have to go to each plot individually.

Is there a way to apply the legend change to all plots?
