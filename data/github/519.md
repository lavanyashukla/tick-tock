### Description

I'm trying to see prediction samples for fastai image classification, where the images are multilabel. I'd like  it to be ran on the validation data at the end of each epoch and to see captions of ground truth/predictions.

When I use a multilabel dataset, instead of ground truth/prediction captions for each image, I get a three copies of each image side by side, where each is labeled, "Input data", "Prediction", "Ground Truth" (but not the actual categories)

### What I Did

`callback_fns += [partial(WandbCallback, input_type='images', monitor='acc_thresholded')]`
