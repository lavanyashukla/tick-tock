TITLE:
Cannot download large artifact completely

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I am logging a large pickle file (572 mb) as an artifact. It shows well on the dashboard.. However when I try to use it in another script with `artifact.download()`, it downloads but I am not able to unpickle it. Raises the following exception: 
```
UnpicklingError: pickle data was truncated
```
And then I check the downloaded artifact file size in the `artifacts` local folder, it is smaller than the original (294 mb). I tried to download it manually from the web interface, still it has smaller size (353mb) and same error when unpickling.
