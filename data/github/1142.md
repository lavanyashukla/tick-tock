Issue using step argument in wandb.log()

### Description

Metric logging is always delayed by 1 step when using the `step=` argument in `wandb.log()`. 
I realize this was an issue in Jupyter notebooks, but it still an issue in ordinary Python scripts. 
I guess the current workaround is to not set the `step` at all, and log a custom step value, but I still feel like this `step` issue should be fixed in the near future. 
Please refer to the below code to reproduce this issue.

### What I Did

```
import wandb
import time

def main():
    wandb.init(name='test', project="arbitrary_project", entity="numpee")
    for i in range(10):
        val = {'val': i}
        wandb.log(val, step=i)
        print("logged")
        time.sleep(60)

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
