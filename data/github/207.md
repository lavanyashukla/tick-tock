TITLE:
wandb signup should take a new user to the API page

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
If I'm not logged in to wandb.com, the command "wandb signup" takes me through the sign up flow but doesn't land me on a page with my api key and the text is:

```
Opened [https://app.wandb.ai/login?signup=true] in your default browser
Paste an API key from your profile:
```

So it's very hard to tell what to do.
