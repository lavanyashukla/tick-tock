[App]: wandb sync hangs forever: Disk quota exceeded

### Current Behavior

### Expected Behavior

Sync works as intended.

### Steps To Reproduce

Any major compute cluster tends to have a small /tmp folder for its users.
Wandb copies all files, including images, to the /tmp folder temporarily for sync.
This is not intended behavior: why does wandb have to copy files to the /tmp directory when it can simply utilize the existing wandb folder inside the directory?
