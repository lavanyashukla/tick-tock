TITLE:
WandbCallback lag [Q]

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I am building a convolutional neural network using keras.compile, and during the training process I used WandbCallback to log the monitored loss into wandb. The problem is that there is significant delay in the logging process. It starts with 1-2 epochs behind and then gradually increases. The delay happens in both Google Colab and Spyder. I am unable to figure it out, so any tips would be appreciated. Please let me know what else I can provide to help make the issue clearer.
