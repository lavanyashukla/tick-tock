TITLE:
[bug] logging images in windows with bad dictionary keys fails without exceptions

LABEL:

**Description**
In windows, calling `wandb.log({"my key: an identifier": wandb.Image(some_tensor)})` results in a successfully finished run, but the image is not uploaded.
The run summary message reports 0 media files, 0 artifacts etc., and the local directory holding the files (i.e. wandb/run-.../files/media/images) has a file with only the "my key" part and no extension with 0 Kb size.
In the app website the run has the object of the image but with no data, and a question mark appears instead.

I think that since ":" is a forbidden character in windows file names the image file creation fails.
Maybe wandb doesn't check that the file creation was successful?
A nicer behavior would be to raise an exception telling the user that he can't use forbidden characters for keys of images.

**How to reproduce**
```python
import wandb
import torch
wandb.init()
wandb.log({"my key: an identifier": wandb.Image(torch.rand(32,32))})
```
