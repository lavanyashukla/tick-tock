TITLE:
[Feature] Docs: add minimum set of s3 permissions needed to use artifact references with wandb[aws]

LABEL:

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Not a big problem - I just wasn't sure exactly what operations wandb would be doing with boto3 behind the scenes to download model artifacts etc. and so I wasn't exactly sure what (minimum set of) permissions I needed to give a machine user / service role when using wandb[aws] to store and retrieve my models.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Just to add something like this minimum set of permission (I may have unnecessary permissions in there I am not 100% sure) to the docs somewhere around [here](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/artifacts/references#s3-gcs-references)?
```js
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucketMultipartUploads",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload",
                "s3:ListBucketVersions",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketVersioning",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:ListMultipartUploadParts"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucketName",
                "arn:aws:s3:::MyBucketName/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
````

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I just trial and error incrementally added permissions until I no longer got error messages

**Additional context**
Error message is something like:
```sh
wandb: Downloading large artifact Model_name:latest, 1061.74MB. 2 files... could not load Model_name
An error occurred (403) when calling the HeadObject operation: Forbidden
```
