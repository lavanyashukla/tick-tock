### Describe the bug

Hello,


I am trying to log my whole directory for each run and not only the `main.py` file. For that I use the following command right after `wandb.init()`:

```
wandb.run.log_code(root=".")
```

However this only captures my `main.py` file. 

I have tried playing with `include_fn` and `exclude_fn` as suggested in the doc but it did not help. Any suggestions on how to fix this issue ?

My directory looks something like:

```
main_dir
    main.py
    folder1
        scriptA.py
    folder2
        scriptB.py
```
PS: I am a bit unsure on how to provide a short reproducible code. Please let me know what I can provide to solve this issue.

Thank you
