### Description

Trying to run a sweep on Google Colab.

### What I Did

So there is no error the sweep just hangs indefinitely after the first run. 

```
wandb: Agent Finished Run
```
I then have to kill it manually 

```
wandb: Ctrl-c pressed. Waiting for runs to end. Press ctrl-c again to terminate them.
Process Process-1:

This is true even on relatively simple things:

I also tested just using a generic train function with no model and it still fails.
