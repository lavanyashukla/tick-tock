[Feature] Zoomable media (images)

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
It would be nice to be able to zoom in on images. Opening an image in full-screen mode is not always sufficient.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Something similar to VSCode's implementation would be great. (Left click - Zoom in, option + Left click - Zoom out)

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
- Using browser zoom (zooms in everything else too so not ideal)
- Outputting several smaller images instead of one large one (more image file organization and management required so also not ideal)
