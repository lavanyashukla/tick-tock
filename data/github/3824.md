TITLE:
[CLI]: `WANDB_DIR` env. var. does not affect the location of the `artifacts/` directory

LABEL:
c:artifacts

STATE:
open

BODY:
I specifically set `WANDB_DIR` so that I can avoid downloading large files on expensive file storage, and instead place them onto cheaper local storage. Why then does the wandb client still download gigabytes of files into the `~/my/project/artifacts` directory? What environment variable do I set to affect where wandb stores these heavyweight files?

AFAIU I don't see any relevant variable in the [official docs](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/environment-variables).
