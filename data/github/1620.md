Allow `wandb.init` to set `wandb.run.dir`.

BODY:
**Problem or Use Case**
I am working with `wandb` and [`hydra`](https://hydra.cc/). Like `wandb`, `hydra` creates a new output directory unique to each run. I would like to unite my `wandb` output directory and `hydra` output directory -- for one, I would like to be able to save my `hydra` `config.yaml` to wandb.ai because it includes _all_ of the parameters (including defaults) and not just the ones that were set from the command line.

**Suggested Solution**
I think the best option would be to have separate `dir` and `base_dir` arguments for `wandb.init`.
