### Description

In the wandb dashboard, when I edit a line plot, I want to visualize only some of the runs. Right now, I can only select "Max runs to show", but it does not allow me to select which runs to show.

### Suggested Solution

Instead of "max runs to show", ask users which specific runs to show.

### Alternatives
