TITLE:
GPU usage is not getting tracked after launching my ipynb notebook from vscode in a conda rendered python env. 

LABEL:
c:system-metrics

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I'm using pytorch to run a deep learning model and honestly a little worried if the model is even using gpu while training although all my tensors seem to show device as cuda:0 but my CPU utilization is hitting 100% alot while gpu also does drop down to 0% while also staying within a 10% range. The GeForce NVIDIA GPU activity panel also shows no active files using GPU as follows :

What is the issue?
