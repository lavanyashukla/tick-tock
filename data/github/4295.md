### Current Behavior

The Line plot sometimes does not visualize values as it should and skips steps in plots with the same x-axis.

I'm currently analyzing the average step time in seconds and there is a big spike after each epoch starts due to the dataset reshuffling.

The second Line plot tracks the data loading time, but it seems to be there is no spike at step 1564.

When zooming into the `step_time_s` plot and navigating the step 1564, the value `1.183s` pops up, but at the `full_dataload_time_s` plot the step selected is **1563** with the value `0.0007579s`.

However, when zooming into the target region of step 1564 in the data loading plot, it switches the y-axis and displays the correct spike with the value `1.155s`. It also correctly displays the same step 1564.

This happens to all line plots that have a similar frequency, i.e., logging at every step.


### Expected Behavior

While it may be impossible to visualize such relatively speaking dense data in a Line plot, I would love to have the value at the same timestep in the tooltip, e.g., it should show the value `1.155s` when navigating to step 1564 in the `step_time_s` plot.
