TITLE:
[Q] Manually extract metrics from .wandb files

LABEL:

BODY:
After using wandb to track metrics for my runs, I’d like to go back and extract those metrics for creating my own plots and visualizations, etc. I know the python API can be used to download them from the server, but what if I just want to access them locally instead of downloading them, which can be slow? I know they’re all stored on disk in a wandb binary log file. Is there a way to read that file locally? That would be really great.
