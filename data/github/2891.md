**Describe the bug**
When I want to download any panel that I saw on the web app it just does nothing. If I choose SVG then the download button becomes completely useless. When I try to use PNG download it just closes the pop-up and nothing happens. There is a " ;( " at the end of the pop-up. I tried it from different browsers, computers, and even users.

1. Go to the runs section
2. Right-click on any panel 
3. Push the export panel 
4. Choose SVG or PNG 
5. Push download button

**Expected behavior**
It should download the panel to allow me to add it to my manuscript
