I'm having this kind of error. and after few hours it crashes with the wandb backend process shutdown.

Is this something to do with `wandb.watch()` ?

I'm using 4 `watch()` functions with log_freq of 100.

and also I'm visualizing the loss and 3 images via wandb by 100 step.

how can I fix this problem??
