[Q] Is there a way to determine if we are in offline mode?

Hi I would like to know what is the best way to determine via the Python API if I am in offline mode?

Currently, I have 2 non ideal solutions:

- Check the `WANDB_MODE` env var
- Call wandb status with `subprocess.run` and parse the output for "mode" == "offline"

The former works when the user sets the env var and the latter works when the user calls `wandb offline`. I know offline can also be passed to the `wandb.init` so this is another use case.

Is there any function from the api I can call to have the current mode?
