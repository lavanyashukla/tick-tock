**Description**
I was running 4 different experiments on an Oracle Grid Engine(aka Sun Grid Engine) cluster. This morning one of my experiments failed from running out of the memory I had allocated to it, and immediately afterwards 2 of the other experiments failed, with identical errors:

Error in atexit._run_exitfuncs:

Exception: The wandb backend process has shutdown

Interestingly, the remaining experiment of the 4 remained intact. It was also coincidentally running on the same machine that encountered the out of memory error, while the experiments that failed were running on different machines.

This is the second time I've had this issue with one experiment failing causing the others to fail, but it doesn't happen every time an experiment fails.

**Wandb features**
wandb.init(), wandb.log(), wandb.watch()

**How to reproduce**
run multiple experiments on cluster, one experiment fails causing others to fail
-only happens once in a while

**Environment**
- OS: linux
- Environment: Python Script
- Python Version:  3.7.0
- Wandb Version: '0.10.32'
