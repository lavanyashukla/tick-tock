TITLE:
List as inputs in sweep yaml

**Python version: 3.6.9**
**wandb version 0.12.5**
**OS: Linux**

**Summary:** In my code `run.py` I use `argparse` for specifying the model's hyperparameters. One of those parameter is the number of hidden layers and their size, which is specified by a list i.e.

`parser.add_argument("--layers_size_prior", default=[500, 500, 500], nargs='+', help="No of units in then hidden layers", type=int)`

Then, I can specify the size of `--layers_size_prior` simply as `python run.py --layers_size_prior 100 100` for example. 

I want to use `sweep` for parameter optimization for `--layers_size_prior`  and I create the following `yaml` file

    project: my_project
    program: ./run.py
    method: grid
    metric:
      name: auc
      goal: maximize
    parameters:
      layers_size_prior:
         values: [500 500 500, 1000 1000 1000]

but I get the following error message

    ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ' '

Which makes me think that there is no `nargs='+'` functionality in `sweep`. 

As a workaround, I did something similar as in [using tuple in sweeps](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1493)
