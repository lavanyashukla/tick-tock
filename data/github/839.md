TITLE:
W&B process failed to launch

LABEL:
c:sync,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:

* Weights and Biases version: 0.8.25
* Python version: Any
* Operating System: ?

### Description

When calling `wandb.init()`, a new process is spawned which performs the metric synchronization with the server.  When the synchronization process takes too long to start (30 seconds) you can see this message: 

```
wandb: Tracking run with wandb version 0.8.22
wandb: ERROR W&B process (PID 19750) did not respond
wandb: ERROR Failed to kill wandb process, PID 19750
wandb: ERROR W&B process failed to launch, see: wandb/wandb-debug.log
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
```

### Status

As of 0.8.25, there are workarounds in place for non jupyter / non windows environments.  We are still investigating some instances of the failure so please send the logs displayed on the terminal as well as the wandb/debug.log from the run that failed.

A workaround for most of the conditions is to set:
```
WANDB_DISABLE_CODE=True
```
or
```
os.environ["WANDB_DISABLE_CODE"] = "True"
```
