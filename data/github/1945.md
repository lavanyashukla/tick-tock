TITLE:
[Feature] Also display corresponding value of x-axis along with y-axis.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
My request isn't related to a problem, rather I thought it'd be convenient if the value of the x-axis (e.g., step number) would also be displayed along with the y-axis value (e.g., F1 score) on the dashboard. It's convenient that the values of the y-axis are displayed as you move along the chart, but sometimes I'd like to know at what step that value was there.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I'm currently saving the best score and corresponding epoch/step so that I print that at the end of the process.
