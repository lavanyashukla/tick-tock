TITLE:
[Q] Is there a way to delete multiple files in a project by pattern matching?

BODY:
My specific use case: I have a project where I upload PyTorch checkpoints named `latest.pt` at the end of every run. I am on the Basic Storage Plan and I'm running out of space. I have hundreds of runs at this point and would like to delete the checkpoints to conserve some space. How do I select and delete all files named `latest.pt` in all the runs under my project? I'm currently doing this manually and it's tedious.

Thanks in advance for the help.
