TITLE:
[App]: Sweep agent mysteriously fails

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

I'm trying to run hyperparameter sweeps with the following parameters:

```yaml
sweep:
  method: random
  project: project_name
  name: sweep_name
  metric:
    goal: minimize
    name: Validation loss
  run_cap: 100
```
Caps is not set on each agent, but a total `run_cap` is set on the sweep controller.

I noticed I'm constantly getting errors like this:

```bash
...
wandb: Find logs at: ./wandb/run-20221214_011259-0jbbwa4t/logs
Run 0jbbwa4t errored: IndexError('list index out of range')
wandb: ERROR Run 0jbbwa4t errored: IndexError('list index out of range')
wandb: Agent Starting Run: mu8l3q87 with config:
...

wandb: Agent Starting Run: s1016hjc with config:
...
wandb: Find logs at: ./wandb/run-20221214_011329-s1016hjc/logs
Run s1016hjc errored: IndexError('list index out of range')
wandb: ERROR Run s1016hjc errored: IndexError('list index out of range')
Detected 3 failed runs in the first 60 seconds, killing sweep.
wandb: ERROR Detected 3 failed runs in the first 60 seconds, killing sweep.
```

And the more agents I launch, the more of them tend to have this error...

I also checked the wandb logs, and found nothing useful in there.
Does anyone know what this error is referring to?
