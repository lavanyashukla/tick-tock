[CLI]: wandb created two sessions for the same run on a slurm cluster

### Describe the bug

My python script calls `wandb.init()` only once (at the beginning of the python script). On a normal remote machine or a local machine, the python script runs without any problems, one launch of the python script created one `wandb` session. 

However, when I launch the same python script on a cluster (which is managed through [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)), one run of the script creates two `wandb` sessions. Each of these two `wandb` sessions has its own run name, for example, `glowing-wind-255` and `pretty-energy-256`. These two `wandb` sessions started at exactly the same time, but their duration can differ by some seconds, this is shown in the screenshot below:

The (beginning of) terminal logging of one run which created two `wandb` sessions is shown as follows:

How can I prevent one run from creating two duplicate `wandb` sessions?
