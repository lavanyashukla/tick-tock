**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I've been training a lot of pytorch models in my python project. After 100 or more models have been trained, I need to load and compare the models. However i need to save 100 and even more models class like in my scripts, which is very time consuming and cumbersome.
```
class model_i(nn.Module):
      something...
```
Therefore, if there a method that when I training the `model_i` the system can automatically save my class to a new .py file. By the way, I don't want to save those classes all together, because I may forget the class name or have the same class name for different stucutures in it with even a single activation function changed.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I know wandb can automatically save the `main.py` , so I want save the structure ,or the model (the code) trained at the same time.
