wandb.log called without a step keyword argument

### Description
Creating a `tf.summary.FileWriter` with a graph makes wandb give a warning about a missing step argument. Graphs are typically not associated with a specific step, so wandb should IMO not give a warning in this case.

### What I Did
Python script:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import wandb

wandb.init(project="test", sync_tensorboard=True)

[...]

writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('logs/', tf.get_default_graph())
```

Output:
```
wandb: WARNING wandb.log called without a step keyword argument.  Pass the same step that tensorboard is using to avoid data loss see:
wandb: WARNING https://docs.wandb.com/docs/integrations/tensorboard.html#custom-metrics
```
