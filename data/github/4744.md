[Q] Offline Mode

BODY:
I would like to run wandb offline and then upload the local data. I tried the following commands in Ubuntu:
```
export WANDB_MODE=offline
wandb init -p TEST_PROJECT
... run my training ...
wandb sync /tmp/run_***
```
The last command returns the message "Skipping directory: /tmp/run_***"

What am I doing wrongly? How can I define the local folder where to save the wandb files?
