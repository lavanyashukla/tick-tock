[Q]is it possible to choose the name of the sweep?

Hello, I just discovered W&B few days ago and it is lovely.
I am running sweeps for my classification model using simpletransformers.
Is there a way one can choose the name of the sweep so that each run will be easily found in the dashboard?
What I am doing now is something like
```
sweep_config = {
    "name": "my_name",
    "method": "bayes",
    "metric": {"name": "accuracy", "goal": "maximize"},
    "parameters": {
        "num_train_epochs": {"distribution" : "int_uniform", "min": 4, "max" : 10},
        "learning_rate": {"distribution" : "log_normal", "mu": -6*log(10), "sigma": .5*log(10)},
    },
    "early_terminate": {"type": "hyperband", "min_iter": 4,},
}
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep_config, project = "my_project_name")

def train():
    wandb.init()

    model = ClassificationModel(
        "bert",
        "dbmdz/bert-base-italian-uncased",
        num_labels=len(label_dict),
        args=model_args,
        sweep_config=wandb.config,
    )

    model.train_model(
        train_df=df_train,
        eval_df=df_val,
        accuracy=lambda truth, predictions: accuracy_score(
            truth, [round(p) for p in predictions]
        ),
    )
    
    model = nil
    wandb.join()

wandb.agent(sweep_id, train)
```
This way the sweep is correctly assigned to "my_project_name" project. However, the names of the sweep and single runs are chosen randomly. I'd like to have something like "my_name_1", "my_name_2", "my_name_3" as names of single runs in the sweep.
Is that possible? it seems that the `"name" : "my_name"` line in the `sweep_config` dictionary is not considered.

Thanks
