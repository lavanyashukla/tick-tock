TITLE:
wandb.watch incompatible with non-contiguous tensors

* Python version: Python 3.7.3
* Operating System: Linux

### Description

I'm running a  complex distributed model, where controlling the contiguity of all tensors at all times is difficult. This seems to be incompatible with the `wandb.watch` which uses `view`s to change the tensor layouts.

### What I Did

Here is the stacktrace:
