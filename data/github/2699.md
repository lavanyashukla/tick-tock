TITLE:
[Q] Python API runs, filter by tags

LABEL:

BODY:
Hello,

I'm using the python API to download the data associated with my runs (using `wandb.Api().runs(...)`, so that I can make my own custom plots.  The examples I've found have covered how to filter based on config values, but I found nothing explaining how to filter based on tag values (or if it is even possible), like it is possible in the dashboard UI.  For the time being, I will proceed by downloading all the data associated with all the tags, and applying a filter locally, but that seems like a wasteful usage of bandwidth, both mine and wandb's.

Is there currently a way to apply a filter based on tag values?  If there is not, I will reopen this as a feature request.

Thank you!
