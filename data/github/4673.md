TITLE:
[Feature]: access tokens for situations like vast.ai

### Description

There is a serious security issue with using services like vast.ai and wandb.  Kagglers have complained about having their code and models stolen when using similar systems in china.   

Being able to create a temporary least privilege access token (some kind of append only token with very limited read access) would help ameliorate this situation.  

It's not perfect, but for those of us who want access to cheap high end GPUs, it would really help a lot.  It also leverages wandb fault tolerant capability with interruptable instances quite nicely.  


### Suggested Solution

The ability to create a temporary least privilege access token that can only append information and not provide read beyond some basic metadata necessary to do what's required.  Github has an example of this in its new fine grained tokens you can look at.   The token could ideally be rate limited as well so vandals couldn't use it to DOS your account (not a huge requirment, but in a perfect world..)

### Alternatives

The only alternative I came up with was not to use wandb and do a sort of roll your own solution by pushing up checkpoints to a cloud storage system where least privilege permissions are possible.

### Additional Context
