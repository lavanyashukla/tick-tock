TITLE:
Make `wandb agent` more resilient to failure

LABEL:

BODY:
wandb agent should perform an exponential backoff up to 5 minutes if the graphql backend is down or returning errors for some reason.  Currently we're using retry logic in the `gql` package.  We can either refactor it or add our own retrying logic in the `wandb agent` process (defined in cli.py).  We should also add a new test_agent.py to tests that ensure's the backoff is working.
