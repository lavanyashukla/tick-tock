Support for PyTorch 1.1 Tensorboard support

LABEL:

BODY:
* Weights and Biases version: 0.7
* Python version: 3.7
* Operating System: CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)

### Description

I was trying to use the new [Tensorboard support in PyTorch 1.1](https://docs.wandb.com/docs/integrations/tensorboard.html) with [Tensorboard 1.14 pre-release](https://pypi.org/project/tb-nightly/).

I understand that this Tensorboard/Tensorflow 1.14 is unreleased yet but should be out soon so hoping this issue gets worked on.

### What I Did

```python
trial = { ... }  # Trial configuration dict.

wandb.init(project=trial.get('project'),
           name=trial.get('name'),
           dir=trial.get('log_dir'),
           config=trial,
           tensorboard=True)
```

Relevant traceback
```shell
  File "/miniconda3/envs/try/lib/python3.7/site-packages/wandb/__init__.py", line 608, in init
    util.get_module("wandb.tensorboard").patch()
```
