Resolve Linter Warnings

BODY:
Let's get rid of the linter warnings before we open source the app.  You can see them all on the terminal by running yarn start in `board/ui`.

@thekatic to run a simple backend for the board/ui frontend you need to run `wandb board` in a directory where you previously ran some jobs.
