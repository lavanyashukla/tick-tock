TITLE:
[Feature] Wandb sweeper for hydra

LABEL:

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently wandb sweeps can be used alongside [Hydra](https://hydra.cc) but it's not very convenient.
Most of the times I would like to overwrite only certain parameters in hydra config, by downloading them from wandb sweep server. This is possible, but requires me to manage the overriding logic by myself.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great if wandb provided a custom sweeper plugin for hydra, similar to the one that's available there for optuna: https://hydra.cc/docs/next/plugins/optuna_sweeper
This way doing sweeps alongside hydra could be as easy as:
```
# initialize sweep and automatically override some of the config parameters
python train.py --multirun hparams_search=wandb_sweep.yaml 
```

**Additional context**
I think supporting sweeps in hydra has been mentioned here recently: https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1233
