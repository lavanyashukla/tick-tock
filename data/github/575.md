### Description
I was trying to pull an experiment by ID and project. 

### What I Did
I ran `wandb pull <ID> -p <project_name> `
and this happend. 
```
Error: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable
```

I went ahead and further looked into the code... it seems that the error is in `apis/internal.py, line 905`. It seems the gql result is `{model: None}` which cause the problem while querying `bucket` key etc.
