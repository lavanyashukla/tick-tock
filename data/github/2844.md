TITLE:
[Feature] Categorical variables in scatterplots

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
When I run experiments I often want to compare categorical values for certain variables, for example the effect of using different network architectures. However, in scatterplots I can only use scalar variables on the X, Y and Z axis. It would be awesome if I could use categorical values here as well, either by specifying an ordered set of values, or by the dashboard automatically assuming one.
