TITLE:
[Feature] Add threshold column to PR Curve and ROC

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
When reading a PR curve or a ROC, I want to be able to see the decision threshold achieving a specific precision/recall or TPR/FPR. Unfortunately, the value of the threshold is not logged in the corresponding table. 

I would like `wandb.plot.pr_curve` and `wandb.plot.roc_curve` to log an additional column `threshold` that gets displayed when hovering the curve.
