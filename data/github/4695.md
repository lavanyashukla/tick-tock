### Describe the bug

Hi. Wandb Team! 
Thanks for providing such a useful tool.
Recently, I use wandb to record my reinforcement learning experiments, which requires to record a video in simulation every fixed step. At the very begining, the videos seems good as follows.

But with the training going, the latest recorded videos started to be broken.

And finally, I cannot see anything but some stripes on almost all new videos.

The broken video looks like:

I am not a expert in video encoding, so I can only provide some basic facts that may help you.
1. The problem does not exist 2 month ago.
2. The basic frames which form the wandb.Video() instance are intact.

It would be great if you could help me to figure out the problem.
