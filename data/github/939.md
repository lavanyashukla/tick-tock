### Description

When doing hyperparameter search for deep learning, individual runs tend to have some variance, that's why one usually does monte carlo cross validation (run multiple runs with the same config, and then average over the results). Please add support for having multiple runs per parameter choice within one group â€“ and have the shown results of that group been the average of the individual values. Bonus points for plots with error bars/additional table entries for error bars.
