TITLE:
Detecting Jupyter notebook name no longer works in Google Colab

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
We special case Google Colab when getting the name of Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/a76ddcef6d6c096ab26a50e2c93573833a638df1/wandb/jupyter.py#L196). This no longer works: `ipynb["metadata"]["colab"]["name"]` no longer exists in the metadata, which results in a `KeyError` exception and we fail to get the notebook name.

Note that the default method of fetching the notebook name works in Google Colab, so we can just remove the special case handling. For now, monkey-patching works:
```
wandb.jupyter.attempt_colab_load_ipynb = lambda: None
```
