TITLE:
Custom Charts: Slow performance when using ROC curve preset

A common use case I'd like to use wandb for is to store accuracy metrics across a number of experimental conditions and training bootstraps, and then compare those metrics faceted by experimental conditions, aggregating bootstraps as variance in the model performance.

I implemented a small demo of that [in this dashboard](https://wandb.ai/stef-stripe/binary-classification-2?workspace=user-stef-stripe), however the dashboard is incredibly slow for me; it takes 30s-1m to load the dashboard in a new tab, and normal interface usage like scrolling, clicking on panel elements, hovering, etc. often have a latency of 5+ seconds.

This is using wandb's `wandb.plot.roc_curve` on a relatively small number of models and a relatively small test set (the ROC tables have 178 values in them each, which is less fine-grained than I'd normally like to see ROC metrics), so I'm concerned about using this in a real use case. Is this slowness expected for plots like this? How could I implement this behavior while retaining a snappy interface, or are there improvements that can be made to the web interface to support these use cases?
