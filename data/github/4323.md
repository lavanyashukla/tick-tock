### Current Behavior

The config.yaml is as follows:
_program: hpo.py
project: random_name
name: hqo
method: grid
parameters:
  seed:
    values: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]_

I ran 8 agents on 8 gpu manually, it gives me 8 runs. **WHILE only 4 seeds are chosen (should be 8) as follows, it wastes half of my gpu!!!**

### Expected Behavior

It should gives 8 runs, each run has a unique seed in [0, 7]
