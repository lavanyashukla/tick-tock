[Feature]: Add ability to pass directory name to wandb.agent

BODY:
### Description

Add ability to pass a directory name to wandb.agent, as it is with wandb.init's dir keyword argument.

An explanation of the request, with code:

```python
def sweep_runner(func: Callable, count: int, sweep_config: dict, project: str, dir: str):
    wandb.init(project=project, dir=dir)
    sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep=sweep_config, project=project_name)
    wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=func, count=count, dir=dir)


sweep_runner(...)
```

### Suggested Solution

The proposed change looks like

```python
wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=some_objective, count=trial_count, dir: Optional[str | Path] = None)
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
A[agent.dir=somepath] --> B(pyagent.dir=agent.dir) --> C(Agent.dir=pyagent.dir) 
```

in Agent, the following change would be made:

```python
os.environ[wandb.env.DIR] = dir or os.path.abspath(os.getcwd())
```

### Alternatives

_No response_

### Additional Context

Currently, one must set an environment variable, WANDB_DIR, for agent. If done incorrectly, this may push logs for a user to an unintended location.

When using Sweeps without the environment variable set, Sweep logs will be created in the current working directory, and run logs will be created in the path provided to wandb.init's `dir`.
