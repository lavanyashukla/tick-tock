TITLE:
wandb in DETR Pytorch StopIteration

LABEL:
stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I am using the code from detr github https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr
When I use wandb I get StopIteration error for no reason whatsoever (It accuses the backbone for not working).

I set up the whole wandb init, config, watch and log.
By only removing the: wandb.watch(model_without_ddp) it works normally.

So my conclusion is that wandb.watch might be changing something inside the model? This is so weird.

Could that be because it actually sends the model to another code for training? (from main.py to engine.py -> train_one_epoch() )
If you would like to replicate the error, it would be too complicated (clone github+download coco dataset).
