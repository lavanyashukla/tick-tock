TITLE:
[App] Runtime value not computed correctly for offline runs

LABEL:

**Describe the bug**
There seem to be two metrics for capturing the total running time of a run - "Runtime" and "Duration". I notice that these metrics don't agree sometimes. "Runtime" is visible in the table view while "Duration" is visible in the details panel of a run (see screenshots). In case it matters, I'm running wandb in offline mode and then running `wandb sync --sync-all` once the run is terminated.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Set `WANDB_OFFLINE` environment variable
2. Run your script which contains `wandb.init(project=...)`
3. Run `wandb sync --sync-all` upon script termination
4. Check "Runtime" value for run on the web app's table view
5. Click on the run name to go to the run view/detailed view and check the "Duration" value

**Expected behavior**
Both values should ideally be similar (if not identical).

Table view showing the "Runtime" for run `fearless-shape-1882` as 1min

Detail view showing the "Duration" for the same run as 1hr (which is correct)


**Operating System**
 - OS: Windows
 - Browser: firefox
 - Version: 0.12.10

**Additional context**
- Running wandb in offline mode
- My guess is that, the "Runtime" value just relies on the "heartbeats" which are absent/non-representative in offline mode, whilst "Duration" actually tracks the difference between the "Created/Start time" and "End time".
