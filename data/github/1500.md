API: Get the group of a run from the api

Hi, there:

   I use the Grouping feature a lot with the wandb web, because it helps me group separate train  and eval for the same experiment (very nice!). However, it seems that the group information (also job_type etc) of run can not be found/access from Api.run.  I'm wondering if it is possible to do so?


Thanks!
