[Q] After logging wandb.plot.line() objects to the same key at each step, how can I visualize them?

Hi,

I have the code:

```python
...
for step in range(1000):
    run.log({ 'myplot': wandb.plot.line(tabdata, 'x', 'y') })
```

Is it possible to have some line plot with a 'step slider' underneath, so that I can see how the line plot evolves as I scan through the training steps?

At the moment, I can't figure out how to do this.  It seems that at each training step, a new "version" of the data is produced in some artifact table (see below).
