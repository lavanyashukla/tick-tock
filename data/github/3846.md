TITLE:
[Q] Does resume='auto' always rerun a crashed run even if I pass a new 'id' in init?

BODY:
Let's say, in my train script, I call my init function as follows:

`wandb.init(entity='me', config=run_config, id=wandb.util.generate_id(), resume='auto')`

Now let's say run with id "run-id-1" crashes, and this script is run again. Will it now do a new run with "run-id-2" or resume "run-id-1"?


PS: Thanks for this amazing tool. It's everything I've ever needed.
