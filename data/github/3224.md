TITLE:
[Q] How to make custom charts be automatically created for future&existing runs?

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
I created some custom charts in the chart view of one run. These charts aggregate some logged metrics. I have multiple runs with the same logged metrics, and I would like to analyze the same chart across numerous future&existing runs.

**How to make custom charts be automatically created for future&existing runs? Is there a function to have a "template" chart view?**
