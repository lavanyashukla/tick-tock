**Description**
Hi. I'm currently working with stable baselines2 and I'm trying to upload the tensorboard metrics to the web UI, but unfortunately not all metrics are uploaded.

Here is an image of the Google Colab tensorboard instance:

And now the tensorboard instance in the web UI:

Did I forget any configuration or is this a bug?
