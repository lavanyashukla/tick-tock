TITLE:
wandb.log information does not appear in wandb app when I initiate the engine with `wandb.init(reinit=True)`

BODY:
### Environment
* Weights and Biases version: 0.8.15
* Python version: 3.7.4
* Operating System: Linux

### Description
I used `wandb.init(project='my project', reinit=True)`, because I want to launch multiple runs in single process. Then, I wrote the code so that each run logs its test performance as follows:
```python
for run in range(n_multiple_runs_with_different_setting):
    wandb.init(project='my project', reinit=True)
    # ... some training script ...
    test_performance = measure_acc(my_model, test_data)
    wandb.log({'performance': test_performance})
```
But I can't see any performance logged in my wandb app. It just shows some hyperparameters I set.
If I fix the init code as `wandb.init(project='my project', reinit=False)`, it successfully log its performance, but as you know, it only works at first run.
Is this behavior intended? How I can do logging for multiple runs in single process?
