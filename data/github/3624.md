TITLE:
[Feature] Is there a process for visually adjusting the thresholds?

LABEL:

BODY:
For example, I get the outputs (logits) of last layer of a segmentation neural network (eg: binary segmentation), and I get the probabilities with the sigmoid function. 

I pass it on the wandb webiste with wandb.Image(). 
 
Is there a way to adjust the threshold on the webpage to see different segmentation results?
