TITLE:
How to use the early terminate module in wandb? I do not quite understand the explaination in docs.

BODY:
I am trying to use wandb sweep to tune the hyperparameter in a model, and also try to use the hyperband early terminate method to accelerate it. 

However, I don't understand how this mechanism works by looking up the docs https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/define-sweep-configuration#early_terminate and the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06560. 

In this paper, the author propose the concept of "resource". In my opinion, in the wandb setting, the "resource" should be num of training epochs. However, in the configuration of "early terminate", I can only see the parameter of "s", "eta", "min_iter" and "max_iter". And through the explaination of the docs, I do not understand the real meaning of them. 

In the github examples, it is tough to see whether the early terminate takes effect, so I hope there will be a simple piece of code to explain how the early terminate works. I wonder if the logged metric shourld be "valid_acc". 

I would be appreciated if anyone can help me understand what early terminate mechanism in wandb sweep actually do, especially the meaning of the parameters, and how to change the training code.
