[CLI]: wand.log doesn't seem to work when including step=

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

if i wandb.log it does not seem to upload when i use step argument as well.  i kind of believe it is something i am doing wrong because it seems like something others would have mentioned and i dont see any other issues or info in release note that is similar from a quick search.  
an example below, if there is a better way to do this (such that step on the graphs doesnt have large "jumps" from point to point) i would love to know but didnt seem to find anything in docs that didnt require multiple wandb.runs at once?

example below but if i use the line `wandb.log({"eval/loss": running_loss}, step=i, commit=True, sync=True)` (and have tried without sync=True or commit=True etc but including here to be more explicit) it does not seem to upload this metric/data as i cannot see it on browser or through api.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
import wandb

wandb.init(project="wanb-test-log-wahoo", config={"a": 1, "b": 2})

num_epochs = 100
num_batches = 1000
eval_every = 1
log_every = 10

running_loss = 1000
eval_metric = 1.0

for i in range(num_epochs):
    for ii in range(num_batches):
        running_loss *= 0.99
        if ii % log_every == 0:
            wandb.log({"train/loss_batch": running_loss})

    if i % eval_every == 0:
        eval_metric += 1 / num_epochs
        wandb.log({"eval/loss": running_loss}, step=i, commit=True, sync=True)

    wandb.log({"train/epoch": i, "train/loss": i / running_loss})


```
