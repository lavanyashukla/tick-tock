TITLE:
[Feature] Delete multiple runs at a time from the web app

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I sometimes run large sets of many runs all at once (possibly in a group, or possibly independently). Occasionally I make a mistake when launching, such as using a wrong hyperparameter, and need to terminate the runs and launch a new set. When this happens, I find myself deleting runs one-by-one on the W&B web app. It would be great if I could instead select multiple runs at once, and delete them all together.
