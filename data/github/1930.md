TITLE:
[App] Missing bounding boxes in images in fullscreen/expanded mode

**Describe the bug**
I do log some images and add bounding_boxes to them with code like:

```python
masked_img = wandb.Image(deprocess_img(pad_image, self.config.experiment.model.backbone), 
                masks={
                    "predictions": {
                        "mask_data": np.squeeze(result),
                        "class_labels": class_labels
                    },
                    "groud_truth": {
                        "mask_data": np.squeeze(pad_target*2.),
                        "class_labels": class_labels
                    }
                },
                boxes={
                    "predictions": {
                        "box_data": [{"position": {"minX": bb[0], "maxX": bb[2], "minY": bb[1], "maxY": bb[3]}, "domain": "pixel", "class_id" : 1,} for bb in pred_bb],
                        "class_labels": class_labels,
                        },
                    "groud_truth": {
                        "box_data": [{"position": {"minX": bb[0], "maxX": bb[2], "minY": bb[1], "maxY": bb[3]}, "domain": "pixel", "class_id" : 2,} for bb in gt_bb],
                        "class_labels": class_labels,
                    }
                })
```

In the web app the images and bounding boxes are rendered fine, but when I click on one image to see it in detail, the boundin boxes are not rendered at all.
However if I click on the download-button on an image (top right corner), the bounding boxes are rendered on the saved image.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Log images with boxes as shown above
2. In the web app, select the run
3. In the media tab the images are shown with bounding boxes rendered
4. Click on an image to see it in fullscreen/expanded view -> No bounding boxes are rendered

**Expected behavior**
I would expect to see the Bounding boxes in the fullscreen mode as well, as I want to inspect the image and the detection results in detail.

**Operating System**
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Browser Chrome (89.0.4389.82)
