TITLE:
Cannot create an Artifact with 7 files of size 975244241 bytes

LABEL:
c:artifacts

STATE:
open

BODY:
I have the following script:
```py
import wandb

if __name__ == "__main__":
  with wandb.init(
      project="private",
      entity="private",
      tags=["DELETEME"],
  ) as wandb_run:
    artifact = wandb.Artifact("deleteme", type="deleteme")

    for epoch in range(100):
      print(f"Epoch {epoch}")
      with artifact.new_file(f"checkpoint{epoch}", mode="wb") as f:
        contents = open("/dev/urandom", "rb").read(975244241)
        print(len(contents))
        f.write(contents)
```
Running this script I see the following error:
```

which is incorrect, considering I have more than enough free space left on disk to fit the files. I've also replicated this on machine with terabytes of disk space left, and still see the same error.

For the sake of exact reproducibility, I'm running with the following `shell.nix`:
```nix
# Run with nixGL, eg `nixGLNvidia-510.47.03 python cifar10_convnet_run.py --test`

# To prevent JAX from allocating all GPU memory: XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false
# To push build to cachix: nix-store -qR --include-outputs $(nix-instantiate shell.nix) | cachix push ploop

let
  # pkgs = import (/home/skainswo/dev/nixpkgs) { };

  # Last updated: 2022-05-16. Check for new commits at status.nixos.org.
  pkgs = import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/556ce9a40abde33738e6c9eac65f965a8be3b623.tar.gz") {
    config.allowUnfree = true;
    # These actually cause problems for some reason. bug report?
    # config.cudaSupport = true;
    # config.cudnnSupport = true;
  };

    # See https://discourse.nixos.org/t/petition-to-build-and-cache-unfree-packages-on-cache-nixos-org/17440/14

    (python3Packages.jaxlib-bin.override {
      cudaSupport = true;
    })
    python3Packages.matplotlib
    # python3Packages.pandas
    python3Packages.plotly
    # python3Packages.scikit-learn
    (python3Packages.tensorflow-bin.override {
      cudaSupport = false;
    })
    # Thankfully tensorflow-datasets does not have tensorflow as a propagatedBuildInput. If that were the case for any
    # of these dependencies, we'd be in trouble since Python does not like multiple versions of the same package in
    # PYTHONPATH.

}
```
In short: I'm running on NixOS 22.05, wandb client version 0.12.16, Python 3.9.12 on a p3.2xlarge EC2 instance. I've also replicated the issue on Ubuntu, and with and without a custom `WANDB_DIR` setting.

Why can't I save 7 files in an Artifact?
