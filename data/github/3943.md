How wandb implement automatically call `run.finish()` when the script exits? I have not found relevant logic in the source code.

And if I call `wandb.finish()` manually, how wandb set `record_writer_thread.stopped` so it will not stuck in infinite loop? I can see `backend.cleanup()` called `wandb_process.join()`, but how wandb_process to finish itself?
