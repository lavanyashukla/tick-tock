Suggestions for logging experiments with different runs and versions.

First of all absolutely loving wandb, thanks to the community and all the contributors to make it happen.

Now here's my doubt. Wandb for each project (or experiment in my case) provides logging different runs of a model, so that let's say if we wanna compare some metric for different learning rate, then it's indeed possible. 
And here the map of the project looks like-

**Project ->**
- Run 1,
- Run 2,
- Run 3...

My doubt is if there's a way of logging different models of different versions with their different runs?
What I mean is let's say I'd want to start a project (experiment), where I'd compare different models (possibly with completely different model architecture) final results, and to get final results of each unique model I would run many runs tweaking hyperparameters etc... So that in this case the map of the project might look like-

**Project ->**
- Version 1
    - Run1,
    - Run2,
    - Run3...
- Version 3
    - Run1,
    - Run2,
    - Run3...
- Version 3
    - Run1,
    - Run2,
    - Run3...
- ......

Thanks.
