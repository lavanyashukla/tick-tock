[Feature]: 3D viz for Table projections

### Description

Hi! The 2D scatter plot projections of table data (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP), are great, but I'd prefer to see 3D versions. 

I wrote my own code using Plotly to do this (https://drscotthawley.github.io/aeiou/viz.html#d-scatter-plots) that supports PCA and UMAP, but these can only be computed beforehand rather than performed "live" within the WandB viewer. 


### Suggested Solution

See for example the Plotly visualization "embeddings_3dpca" in Media section of the run https://wandb.ai/drscotthawley/dvae-masked/runs/27a3f2jg?workspace=user-drscotthawley

All of the projection methods in the WandB Table viewer support arbitrary numbers of dimensions. The change would just be the visualization package used -- can't use Bokeh or Seaborn.  Plotly is a good one though. 


### Alternatives

_No response_

### Additional Context

When visualizing high-dimensional data, preserving as many visualization dimensions as possible can be helpful to better see the structure of the data.
