### Description

Would be nice if there was a way to update the type of an artifact. Currently raises `AttributeError`:

```py
import wandb

wandb.login()
wandb_api = wandb.Api()

artifact = wandb_api.artifact("entity/project/run-3s5g8iwy-95.json.gz:v0")

artifact.type = "new-artifact-type"

>>> AttributeError: can't set attribute 'type'
```

### Suggested Solution

```py
artifact.type = "new-artifact-type" # should not raise error here

artifact.update()
```
