TITLE:
[App]: Parallel coordinates average metrics in the Group

### Current Behavior

I couldn't find a way to visualize runs in the group separatelly. I am running ray.tune.run with WandbLoggerCallback, setting the group number and for each run, I send extra parameters with wandb.Api() and this works fine. The problem comes when I am trying to visualize all runs in parallel coordinates, that averages all metrics across runs, rather than showing each of them individually.

I was able to show the metric final_performance of each run separately only if I specify some parameters in the configuration that two runs differ. The default behavior was to average these (options are mean, median, min, max).

### Expected Behavior

I would expect that there is a way to show each run from the same group separately in parallel coordinates, or in the plot as default.
