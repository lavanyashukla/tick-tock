TITLE:
[Q] How to aggregate metrics on the client before logging?

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I currently do the following to try to reduce the amount of syncing to the server (I noticed calling `wandb.log` without doing this slowed down my training runs by 2x):

```
def commit()
    return random.randint(0, 100) == 0

# each time I call wandb.log
wandb.log({ "step": step }, commit=commit())
```

The idea is to commit the logs around once every hundred steps.
But I don't think that this is what is actually happening. How would I do what I'm trying to do?
