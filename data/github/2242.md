[CLI] Save files with wandb.save without the folder structure

**Description**
When I call e.g.  `wandb.save(config.results_dir + "latest_checkpoint.pth")` the entire folder structure will be saved. This can be annoying if I want to restore files or inspect them online in some cases. Is there a way to only store the file without the folder structure in wandb?
