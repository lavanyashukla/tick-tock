TITLE:
How to pass a dictionary as a hyperparameter when doing sweep and assign a name to it [Q]

BODY:
This code can be used to pass hyperparameters for a sweep:
```
parameters_dict = {
    'optimizer': {
        'values': ['adam', 'sgd']
        },
    'fc_layer_size': {
        'values': [128, 256, 512]
        },
    'dropout': {
          'values': [0.3, 0.4, 0.5]
        },
    }
```

Is there a way I can pass a dictionary and assign a name to it that will be displayed in the hyperparameter chart? I know I can pass a dictionary as argument, for example: `arc: {'values': [{'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'a': 2, 'b': 3}]}`, but it is not displayed in the chart because it isn't one value, e.g., the hyperparameter is the dictionary itself. 

Specifically, what I'd like is  `arc: {'values': [{'first': {'a': 1, 'b': 2}}, {'second': {'a': 2, 'b': 3}}]}`, and then the chart will have `first` and `second`. Is there a way to do something like this?
