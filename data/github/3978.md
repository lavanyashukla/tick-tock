Hi, there, I'm using a WandbLogger (wandb=0.12.21) in pytorch lightning 1.6.5, and find that the `output.log` file is empty when set offline mode. The problem disappear when using online mode. I've tried setting os.environ["WANDB_CONSOLE"] = "auto", "redirect", or "wrap", but not help. Could you help me to deal with this problem?
