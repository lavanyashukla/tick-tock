TITLE:
[App] Table scaling hides audio player controls

LABEL:
app

STATE:
closed

BODY:
The scaling of tables including audio sometimes prevents the user from accessing the audio player controls. This also happens in some tables of the tables tutorial https://wandb.ai/stacey/cshanty/reports/Tables-Tutorial-Recreating-Whale-Melodies-on-Orchestral-Instruments--Vmlldzo4NDI3NzM

See also this screenshot from the tutorial:

I observed this behavior in both Firefox and Chromium browsers on Linux and Windows using 4k and 1080p Screens.
