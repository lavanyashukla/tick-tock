TITLE:
[CLI] Process saving to NFS hangs, possibly related to wandb client

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
Long-running jobs regularly hang without an identifiable cause. The jobs do not crash or complete; they become stuck, waiting on I/O (process state S/Sl). `strace` suggests wandb _might_ be involved, maybe something specific to wandb + NFS.

**Wandb features**
Currently using `wandb.init`, `wandb.log`, `wandb.watch`.

**How to reproduce**
Very difficult to reproduce; cause unknown. The problem has occurred in 6 jobs run on a slurm cluster in the past 24 hours. See the system logs from wandb, which show a large network activity spike a bit before GPU utilization went to zero (i.e. the process hung). Not sure if this is related. Note these figures are zoomed in; the process stayed frozen, without crashing, for another 8 hours (still hanging).

Output of running `strace -p` on the hung process is also [attached](https://github.com/wandb/client/files/6518443/strace.txt).

**Environment**
- OS: Ubuntu 16.04
- Environment: slurm cluster with NFS
- Python Version: 3.6.13
- wandb version: 0.10.30

Happy to provide any other information possible to help identify the cause of this issue (if it is in fact wandb related, which it might not be).
