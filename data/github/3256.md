TITLE:
[CLI] Artifact.add_reference method throws error for files with same names but in different folders.

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
* I have folders of video frames where the filenames correspond to video timestamps.  
    As a result, some filenames occur across different folders.
* These files are then wrongly detected as duplicates;  
    when trying to add these files as reference artifacts using the `Artifact.add_reference` method, `ValueError: Cannot add the same path twice: 0000_16840.png` is raised.

**Wandb features**
[wandb.Artifact.add_reference](../blob/412f7eb4f53fb36a91422ea477ecabe6a8ad52c2/wandb/sdk/wandb_artifacts.py#L423..L455)

**How to reproduce**
1. To reproduce the error:  
    https://gist.github.com/salehahr/b90f79ccd9960fbca1890277791b92c0 
    ```python
    import wandb

    files = [
        "/graphics/scratch/schuelej/sar/data/256/GRK011/0000_00000__0000_39000/skeleton/0000_16840.png",
        "/graphics/scratch/schuelej/sar/data/256/synthetic-bladder09/skeleton/0000_16840.png",
        # "/graphics/scratch/schuelej/sar/test/folder1/0000_16840.png",
        # "/graphics/scratch/schuelej/sar/test/folder2/0000_16840.png",
    ]

    with wandb.init(project="dataset2") as run:
        data = wandb.Artifact(name="temp-data", type="dataset")

        for file in files:
            uri = f"file://{file}"
            data.add_reference(uri)

        run.log_artifact(data)
    ```
2. Describe what we have to do in order to trigger the issue  
    * Create a similar file structure as in the `files` list in the code above, and run the code.
    * Commenting the first two files in `files` and uncommenting the bottom two gives different errors when running the code:  
        * Running with only the first two files results in `ValueError: Cannot add the same path twice: 0000_16840.png`
        * Running with only the bottom two files results in a successful run, but only the last file is saved (overwrites the second to last file).

**Traceback**
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/graphics/scratch/schuelej/sar/tfgraph/mwe_duplicate_artifacts.py", line 15, in <module>
    data.add_reference(uri)
  File "/graphics/scratch/schuelej/system/miniconda3/envs/tfgraph/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/sdk/wandb_artifacts.py", line 455, in add_reference
    self._manifest.add_entry(entry)
  File "/graphics/scratch/schuelej/system/miniconda3/envs/tfgraph/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/sdk/interface/artifacts.py", line 94, in add_entry
    raise ValueError("Cannot add the same path twice: %s" % entry.path)
```

**Additional notes**
I saw that the `entry` objects created [here](../blob/412f7eb4f53fb36a91422ea477ecabe6a8ad52c2/wandb/sdk/wandb_artifacts.py#L1263..L1265) end up having the base filename in the `entry.path` attribute instead of the full filepath. Could this possibly be the cause for the false duplicates?
