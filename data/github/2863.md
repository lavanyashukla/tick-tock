[Q] Wandb sync --no-sync-tensorboard for runs created with tensorboard

LABEL:

BODY:
I've found a workflow for doing a large number of runs offline on an HPC (pre-generating commands with sets of parameters), but I've been having issues with how large my files are when I go to sync. The issues are that syncing is slow (since each upload is pretty large) and that I essentially have to dump my homemmade sweeps from wandb after I've made plots because they take me to my data cap.

In each script, I call `wandb.init(..., sync_tensorboard=True, mode='offline',...)` and end with `wandb.finish()`

Then when I go to sync, I call `wandb sync --sync-all --no-sync-tensorboard ./wandb`

**Expected behavior**: Sync the .wandb file and other files to wandb while ignoring the .tfevents symlink
**Actual behavior**: Does the above, but also syncs the .tfevents file/

I'm mostly using the tensorboard out of convenience, and I'm logging a lot of data. Judging by the size of the .wandb files themselves, the data is in there, so I don't think I should need to be uploading the additional .tfevents file. 

Do I have this correct? If so, what can I do to make it ignore tfevents? An easy hack would be to do a quick command to delete all symlinks. If I'm not right, would it be more space-efficient to just use the wandb.log functionality?
