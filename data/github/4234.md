TITLE:
[Q] How to log at different frequencies and 2 different training runs

LABEL:

BODY:
I have the following code structure

```
for ep in range(num_epoch):
    # do some training stuff
    wandb.log({"some_metric": some_metric})
    if ep % 5 == 0:
        wandb.log({"another": another})

for ep in range(num_epoch):
    # do some different training stuff say stage 2 training
    wandb.log({"some_metric_2": some_metric_2})
```
I want to log the above metrics in such a fashion. But the problem that I face is the following - the logger is maintaining a global step counter so that is causing inconsistencies in logging which can be obviously seen from the above code. I tried instantiating different loggers by `run = wandb.init()`, but that does not seem to be working.
