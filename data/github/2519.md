[Q]How do we define the metric name in swep.config?

Hi I'm a newbie in using wandb. When I looked into the tutorials, I'm a bit confused about this metric name definition.
For example here,
```
sweep_config = {
    "method": "bayes",  # grid, random
    "metric": {"name": "train_loss", "goal": "minimize"},
    "parameters": {
        "num_train_epochs": {"values": [2, 3, 5]},
        "learning_rate": {"min": 5e-5, "max": 4e-4},
    },
}
```
I saw some people use metric name "train_loss", some use "val_loss", some use "loss". So I wonder if there's a dictionary where we could select the name from? What's the difference when we pass the metric name "val_loss" and "loss"?
If I want to optimize my hyperparameters by calculating "AUC_ROC", what exact name should I give to this sweep config? "auroc" or "auc_roc"? Does it matter if there's a typo error? 

Sorry I really couldn’t find a standard instructions for this one. Because I don’t know how sweep understand the metric we want it to optimize by just passing a "name" to it ?

Thanks very much! I would appreciate any help!
