[Q] Can the wall-time curves be exported as a csv file?

Hi,

wandb offers an option where one can plot a y-value of interest against the relative wall time of the run. When trying to download the csv data for such a run, it looks like the data only consists of one line and does not include y-values against the wall-time x values. Do you know if there is some way to access this information?
