[Feature] Resume offline runs

BODY:
Whenever I need to resume a run, I have to make sure it has been synced to the cloud before I try to resume it. It would be nice to be able to resume offline runs. 

The following code demonstrates the problem. If you are running on "dryrun" mode, you will not be able to resume the run. 

```python
import os
import wandb

os.environ["WANDB_MODE"] = "dryrun" # This does not work
# os.environ["WANDB_MODE"] = "run" # This works
wandb.init(project="test")
wandb.config.update({"first_run": True})
run_id = wandb.run.id
wandb.run.save()
wandb.finish()
# Resuming run
wandb.init(project="test", id=run_id, resume="must")
if wandb.run.resumed: print("Resuming run")
else: print("Run not resummed")
wandb.finish()
```
