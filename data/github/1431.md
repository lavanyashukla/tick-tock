TITLE:
Suppressing the run summary generated when a wandb process finishes?

Hi, 

I have to write my code to handle both multiprocessing (ray) and without multiprocessing, and I believe the easiest way to use wandb for this is to wrap all calls that use wandb in a context manager, e.g.,

```
with wandb.init(project='project', reinit=True) as run:
    train(run)

with wandb.init(project='project', reinit=True) as run:
    evaluate(run)
```

However, every time the context ends, wandb prints the run summary, with a huge number of metrics printed to the console. Can I suppress this summary in some way?
