TITLE:
[Q] Adding Paramter after run is done

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I would like to add a single parameter to my config after a run is done, preferably by using the browser gui.
I know I should log it in the future, but adding this parameter for some older runs would let me use some plots for earlier runs.
Is adding parameters after ending a run possible?
Edit: Or maybe I could change my config.yaml in a wandb-run folder and log the whole run again?
