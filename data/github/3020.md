Hi wandb team, 

I really find the hyperparameter list/diff to be really useful in the UI, but it would be great if we could hide certain types of diffs. For example, image diffs, as they can clutter the UI. 

Here's an image of the images cluttering the diff list:

Alternatively, if this feature is already present, how can I use it? Thank you for reading!
