TITLE:
[App] Missing Scrolling on Artifacts -> Files tab

LABEL:
app

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
I could not scroll to the end of the page on the Artifacts -> FIles tab, only see the top of the frame. I have to zoom out to see the end of the file list and the page switcher. 

**Expected behavior**
Well, I want to scroll along the long list without a need to zoom out

**Screenshots**
Scrolling on Normal zoom just gets me this far:

The end of the file list and the pages switcher become visible on 33% scale

**Operating System**
 - OS: Win 10
 - Browser: Chrome
 - Version: 90.0.4430.85 (latest, as far as I know)
 - Screen resolution: 1920 x 1080

**Additional context**
I see this in the Browser console, in case it's related
