TITLE:
Cannot use pytorch-lightning logger and log artifacts in the same run

**Describe the bug**
Two different runs are created when using the pytorch-lightning logger and also logging artifacts.

**To Reproduce**
To log the version of my data set as an artifact I do:
```python
run = wandb.init(project='My-project', job_type='train')

artifact = wandb.Artifact('Artifact-name', type='dataset')
artifact.add_dir('./data_dir/')
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```
Then I create my model and data_set class etc. (just follow the normal pytorch-lightning steps)
At the end I create the wandb pytorch-lightning logger:
`wandb_logger = WandbLogger(project='My-project', offline=False)`
and pass it to the Trainer(). As normal for all loggers.

The problem is that `wandb.init()` starts a new wandb run and the logger also starts a new run. 

**Expected behavior**
The logging of the artifact and the things the pytorch-lightning logger logs should be logged in the same run. Otherwise there are a lot of empty runs on the dashboard.
