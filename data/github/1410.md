hi, there:

  I found that the aggregation option of bar chart seems not work for me. Below is a screenshot

Changing Agg to mean/min/max does not make any difference. I guess wandb is only loading the metric from the final step. But in some cases (my previous plots weeks ago), the option worked, i.e., doing aggregation across steps. 

I do have the metric from different runs, and the line plot is working properly, see below

Thanks!
