[Feature] Resume sweeps

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
In the [documentation on resuming runs](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/resuming), there is a note that says:

`Note that resuming a run which was executed as part of a Sweep is not supported.`

I often want to resume runs that I executed during a sweep -- for example, to train for longer if they haven't finished converging. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd love if resuming sweeps was supported!

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
The alternatives I see are all undesirable -- loading the run from a saved checkpoint and training in a new run (loses connection to all the old plots), or training from scratch with more epochs (waste of time and compute).
