BODY:
Hello, thanks for all the work.
Would love to see whether it is possible to have a step count for each plot.
This is useful to 
1. compare against different runs from different machines (with different batch size/runtime
2. epoch-based metrics (ROC etc.
3. tracking validation loss during training
