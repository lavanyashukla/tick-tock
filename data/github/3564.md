TITLE:
Is there a way to delete local runs's folder automatically?

BODY:
wandb is a perfact tool for us ML researchers, however I found runs's local folder takes a huge disk space, so I was wonder is there  a way to delete local folder right after this runs finished/crashed/failed? I implement a code based on multiprocessing and python `tempfile` module, however it always crashes and create so many empty runs like https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1869 mentioned

My code for `main.py`:
```python
for i in range(10):
    process = Process(target=wandb.agent, args=(sweep_id, lambda: runner(wandb_config, params_default), 'realcrush', 'ON-GNN', ))
    list_process.append(process)
    process.start()
for p in list_process:
    p.join()
```

My code for `runner`:
```python
def runner(wandb_config, params_default):
    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdirname:
        temp_dir = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()
        wandb_config['dir'] = tmpdirname
        wandb.init(**wandb_config, config=params_default)
        ...
        wandb.finish()
```

An empty run created by agent: https://wandb.ai/realcrush/ON-GNN/runs/gtwbebop/overview?workspace=user-realcrush

I believe there are some error with python `tempfile` module as https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1869#issuecomment-847464464 said, by the way, is there an official way to achive my goal?
