[Feature]: terminate sweep agents when sweep is done

### Description

Hi
Can we add an option to terminate the sweep agent when the sweep is done?
Currently the behavior is, wait on queue for new sweep config indefinitely.

Use case: 
We have a job scheduling system that allocate resources (CPU and GPU) and runs training script in the job queue. The currently behavior is problematic since it will wait on a queue indefinitely and won't release the resource when the sweep is done.


### Suggested Solution

add option --terminate-on-finish
