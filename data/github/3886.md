TITLE:
[Feature]: Support for Artifact.add_reference(HuggingFace Hub id) 

LABEL:

BODY:
### Description

The current implementation of Artifacts supports remote storage on cloud providers such as AWS and GCP as well as natively providing a local file path to files in local storage to log and store remotely on üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è W&B. 

As part of the model training process in the HuggingFace Ecosystem it is now common to automatically push a model to the HuggingFace Hub due to the integrated functionality within the HF Trainer. While it is possible to add a reference to the model_hub_id in the current functionality provided by W&B  `artifact.download()` will not resolve anything.

Also uploading the model weights to W&B is in some cases an unnecessary duplication, but logging the artifact's existence is important for the overall reproducibility and keeping track of the full data and model lineage on weights and biases.

### Suggested Solution

Suggest to add a `HFHubHandler` to `wandb/sdk/wandb_artifacts.py`

In order for the handler to identify it is a huggingface hub reference, we would need to add a unique reference as a prefix such as `hfhub://` in `hfhub://Kayvane/distilbert-complaints-wandb`. 

This reference can be parsed by `Multihandler` as an additional `_handler` reference.

### Alternatives

It's possible to bypass the integration and add a metadata reference to the artifact of the object type `dataset` or `model` and require the user to build a parser to use the reference in the correct library through either:

A dataset:

```
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("consumer-finance-complaints")
```

or

A Model:

```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Kayvane/distilbert-complaints-wandb")

model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("Kayvane/distilbert-complaints-wandb")
```

### Additional Context

(edited)
I have added an example of how to add a hub_id as part of the artifact metadata and using that within the transformers library. A tighter integration would still be better, i.e. if the artifact.download() button would perform these steps behind the scenes and return artifacts directly.
