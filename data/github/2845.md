TITLE:
[CLI] race condition with multiple users using wandb on the same machine

**Description**

If a user starts a new project without a `wandb` directory in the project root, `wandb` will log to `/tmp/debug-cli.log` as set in the following lines.

https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/1d623ac04139d5a72c9f7691e18517e4950849b7/wandb/cli/cli.py#L47-L49

In our university environment we have many students using `wandb` on the same server. The first student creates the temp logging file and all others get an error like the following because of this.

Of course, this can be fixed by `mkdir wandb` in the project directory, but I still think this should be fixed.

**Wandb features**
What lines of wandb code are you using? This could be wandb.init(), wandb.log(), or features like the Keras callback, the Hugging Face integration, or PyTorch Lightning integration, for example.

**How to reproduce**

See description.

**Environment**
- Ubuntu Server 20.04
- two users using `wandb` simultaneously for the first time
