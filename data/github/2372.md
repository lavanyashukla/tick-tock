TITLE:
[Q] Filter by value from chart query for custom chart

LABEL:

BODY:
Is there any way to filter a `HistoryTable` by column value directly from the chart query?

What I am currently doing is using a filter in Vega Lite, but this requires me to save multiple version of my custom chart for different tables (The filter value is already defined as configurable **field**, but the column name changes from table to table).
