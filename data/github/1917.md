**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I want to protect my best runs from being accidentally deleted. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be nice if I could put a lock on a run so that I can't accidentally delete it when I am cleaning my wandb run table at a later point in time.
