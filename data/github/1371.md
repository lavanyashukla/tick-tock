TITLE:
Can't add evaluation logs to a finished run

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
It seems to be impossible to log to a run once it has been marked "_finished_".
Shouldn't it be possible to run further evaluations on a _finished_ training run?!

snipped from `eval.py`:
```python


        run = None

        if tb_log and arguments.platform == 'slurm':  # only do this once for a multi-GPU job

            api = wandb.Api()
            runs = api.runs('cvpr_2021/pcdet')

            # try to find training run on WAND (maybe does not exits)
            for r in runs:
                if r.name == arguments.folder.split('/')[-1]:
                    run = r
                    run.dir = output_dir
                    break

            if run: 

                 step = int(accumulated_iter)  # accumulated_iter sometimes is a String and WAND currently can't handle that

                 run.log({identifier: value}, step=step)
```

resulting error message:
```
    run.log({identifier: value}, step=step)
  File "/home/martin/anaconda3/envs/PCDet/lib/python3.6/site-packages/wandb/apis/public.py", line 530, in __getattr__
    "'{}' object has no attribute '{}'".format(repr(self), name)
AttributeError: '<Run cvpr_2021/pcdet/3g4f3tpq (finished)>' object has no attribute 'log'
```

Note:
I also encountered another issue:
                 `step = int(accumulated_iter)  # accumulated_iter sometimes is a String and WAND currently can't handle that`
