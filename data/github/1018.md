### Description

I'm trying to run wandb with ray (https://github.com/ray-project/ray), where I am training two models at once, one as a `ray.remote` process. I want to have two wandb experiments for each model, rather than using the same experiment. However, I can't seem to get it to work using ray. MWE below with a description.

### What I Did

The following MWE script outlines how I can reproduce the error. Basically, it calls the first function as a `ray.remote function`, then immediately calls `second_fn`. Because ray's scheduler isn't immediate, `second_fn` is called first and creates the first wandb experiment (`'test_second_fn'`). Then once `first_fn` is actually called, it also tries to create a wandb experiment (`'test_first_fn'`) but some things break (output after the MWE), and shut down all the logging for both experiments (as far as I can tell -- no values are logged, but the console log for `test_first_fn` is still updating, where as the console log for `test_second_function` is not). 

```
import ray
import wandb

from time import sleep

@ray.remote(num_gpus=0, num_cpus=1)
def first_fn():
    print('Calling first function and creating test_first_fn')
    wandb.init(project='test_project', name='test_first_fn')

def second_fn():
    print('Calling second function and creating test_second_fn')
    wandb.init(project='test_project', name='test_second_fn')
    sleep(1000)

def train():
    ray.init(num_cpus=1, num_gpus=0, memory=100 * (1024 ** 2))
    first_fn.remote()
    second_fn()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    train()
```

Relevant output of this. Messages with (pid=25954) are coming from the call to `first_fn`.

```

That link (ID `3oa6cwhf`) is associated with the `test_second_fn` experiment.

Is there any way to get this to work with ray?

Edit: worth mentioning that this results in the same error as #940 but there don't seem to be any unicode errors. If you comment out either of the two function calls, wandb should initialize properly.

Also, I'm not trying to do a ray tune, which it seems like wandb supports. 

Thanks!
