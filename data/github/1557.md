Hey

**What I want to do**: After completely training a model (and logging all
kind of metrics to wandb) I want to do several computations and plot
custom line plots. I did so using wandb.log and wandb.plot.line
functions as illustrated in the Documentation. In the end, I want to
have various runs, each of which did plot this function, and I want to
compare these function.

**The problem**: When I select grouping within the Wandb webinterface,
metrics that were logged over epochs/steps are grouped as usual, but
custom plots are not. It would be highly valuable for me to compare
these custom functions I plotted, averaged by groups.

While this is not implemented, does someone know a workaround for this?
Thanks!
