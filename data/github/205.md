For fun, I blew away my wandb directory and ran `wandb init` again from scratch. The command worked fine:

```
(wandb-3.6) adrian@Adrians-MBP:~/src/wandb-old-examples/keras$ wandb init

This directory is configured!  Next, track a run:
* In your training script:
    import wandb
    wandb.init()
* then `python <train.py>`.
```

but the resultant settings file was messed up:

```
