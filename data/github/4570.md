TITLE:
wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish... (success).[Q]

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
The trial was completed. Wandb is waiting for the data to be transferred and draws the corresponding image. However, only the first point of data appears on the wandb page, and the rest of the data is never transferred. The log file is not being updated, either.I've tried reducing the batchsize of the model in the hope of reducing the amount of data uploaded, and I've waited overnight, but both failed and the data seems to have disappeared.
