Morning team, I am trying to get all the versions of a registered model, currently I am using such a loop:

```
for index in range(0, N):
  wandb.use_artifact(f"[[entity/]project/]registeredModelName:v{index}")
```

Is there a way I can get a list of all the available versions through the API?

Thanks in advance!
