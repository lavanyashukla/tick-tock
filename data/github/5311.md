TITLE:
Entire project needs to be emptied once a logging mistake was made

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
Let's say I wanted to pass a histogram in RUN #1325 in my project but I forgot to transform the tensor to a histogram and now I see this:

```
Selected runs are not logging media for the key <key>, but instead are logging values of type histogram.

If <key> is never supposed to be a media type, please delete this panel and create the proper panel type manually.
```

The only way to plot after fixing is to start a new project.
Is there a way to fix this?
