I have been using w&b for tracking my argparse args. However I often found that the one arg flag should be renamed or should be removed that completely. However the old arg flag still persists in the w&b ui.  
For example, I think I no longer need the `folder_name` flag and would like to remove it from the w&b run tables as well. But currently I don't think there is a method to do that other than just mark this column invisible.

I think these unwanted flags will pile up and make browsing the config args cumbersome in that people would see some flags unused in the code. Also if the programmer mistyped a flag, it would remains in the run tables. Then if we do a filter by that flag we could mistakenly filter by a mistyped flag.
Thanks!
