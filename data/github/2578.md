[CLI] CondaEnvException since v0.12.0

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
**Description**
When using `wandb`, I get a `CondaEnvException`:

```
CondaEnvException: Unable to determine environment

Please re-run this command with one of the following options:

* Provide an environment name via --name or -n
* Re-run this command inside an activated conda environment.
```

**Wandb features**
`wandb.init()` is enough to reproduce the bug but it occurs also on more complex codes.

**How to reproduce**
```
import wandb
run = wandb.init()
run.finish()
```

**Environment**
- OS: Mac OS BigSur 11.3.1
- Environment: Conda environment
- Python Version: [eg. 3.8.5]
