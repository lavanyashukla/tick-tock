TITLE:
[Q] Log image per epoch and have slider per epoch

Hello,

In my training loop I am logging an image generated from the data at every epoch. I am using PyTorch Lightning and Weights & Biases. The command I'm using is like the below:

```
fig = # compute fig
self.logger.experiment.log({"heatmap": [wandb.Image(fig)]})
```

However, when I log it to wandb, I get a weird slider which is not epochs but random steps. For example the first step is step 14, the second is step 19, the third is step 24 etc. So even though I can slide the slider to see the progress, I never really know which epoch each image corresponds to.

Alternatively, I tried to log multiple images (which is an uglier way) by putting the current epoch number as part of the title:

```
fig = # compute fig
self.logger.experiment.log({f"heatmap_e{self.current_epoch}": [wandb.Image(fig)]})
```

This logs multiple images with the epoch number, but does so in a seemingly arbitrary order. If I use the sorting functionality, I still don't get a correct sorting of the images, but a different arbitrary combination.

So to summarise:
Question/Issue 1) How to log images on every epoch and have a slider epoch instead of random steps?
Question/Issue 2) How to sort multiple images in a correct order instead of arbitrarily?
