TITLE:
[App] Table not updating it at each call of log

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
I have a code for which I want to log some metadata at each step. I thought I could log this metadata in a Table, unfortunately the table is not updated on the app after the first call to log.

My code is something like

```
metadata = [["I love my phone", "1", "1"]]
table = wandb.Table(data=metadata, columns=["Text", "Predicted Label", "True Label"])
wandb.log({"metadata": table})

run = wandb.init(**config)
with run:
    for step in steps:
        ## some code
        table.add_data(*metadata)
        run.log({"examples": table})
```

On the app, I can only see the initial table with `data` no rows are added to it.
Note that the corresponding artifact is also not updated. Maybe this is due to wandb assigning the same identity to initial and updated table and not logging it again?
