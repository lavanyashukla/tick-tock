Update tracked parameters late in training

Hi there! I was just wondering if there was any way to update a model whose parameters have been unfrozen after starting training (i.e. at iteration N, I set requires_grad = True and give it a .grad value). If I do this, the unlocked parameters are not displayed in the visualization.

Thanks!
