TITLE:
[CLI] Creating a table from a dataframe with enum values as column headers fails

LABEL:

**Description**
As the title says. Creating a Table from a dataframe with enum column names causes the following exception

`columns argument expects list of strings or ints`

**Wandb features**
Table()

**How to reproduce**
1. See above

**Environment**
- Python Version: 3.9

There are two fixes for this in my mind:

1. The _assert_valid_columns call is too restrictive and should at least attempt to cast the columns to strings 
2. The error above should be more clear. I had not given the `columns` argument to the Table constructor, and yet that's what it was suggesting I did wrong.
