TITLE:
[Feature]: Don't automatically add new columns to the wandb project page

### Description

When I run a run that logs new metrics (ie metric keys that weren't in the previous runs in that project), those metrics will be automatically added to the project's "Table" view. This is quite frustrating since I usually manually set up my project's columns as I want them - and then often I'll add a bunch of metrics to my runs, and they'll all immediately clog up my project table view page. It's not unusual for me to add a hundred new metrics to a run (stuff like `test_score/[TEST_CASE_X]/test_metric`), and then those will all show up in the table view. If I want to remove them I have to either manually click on each unwanted metric (a hundred clicks), or hit "hide all" and re-set up all the columns again.

Eg here is my current situation - there's no easy way to get this cleaned up without just resetting everything:

### Suggested Solution

Don't automatically add new metrics to the Table view on the project page. Especially if the user has manually configured the column view, and especially if they're not hyperparameters (I almost never want the majority of the actual run metrics in this table view - usually just the hyperparameters and maybe one or two topline test results).
