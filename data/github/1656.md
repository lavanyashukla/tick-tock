TITLE:
Choosing aggregation function for table column

BODY:
So I've seen the similar issue came up a while ago #1380.

**Problem/Use Case**
The problem is we can't compare experiments by metrics like max accuracy achieved over the whole run, unless we log explicitly from the code what was the max accuracy.

**Suggestion**
Why not just add to table view an option to choose  aggregation function for given column?

This would make my life much easier because currently I need to keep track in the code what was the max achieved accuracy and log it explicitly.
