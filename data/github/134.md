TITLE:
Description doesn't get set in headless mode.

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I ran this command:
WANDB_API_KEY=<api_key> WANDB_ENTITY=shawn WANDB_MODE=run WANDB_PROJECT='headless-check' WANDB_DESCRIPTION='a-headless-run4' wandb run train.py

Here's the run: https://app.wandb.ai/shawn/headless-check/runs/s8q6gi4c

Everything works except for the description. This is a critical feature, need to fix ASAP.
