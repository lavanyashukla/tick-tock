### Description

After signing up through the website, there's no direction on how to get started. I figured it out by reading the ["Getting started" documentation](https://docs.wandb.com/docs/started.html). Might propose an alert box for accounts with 0 projects, linking to getting started docs.

Also, found it odd the nav links were disabled by default. I was expecting to be able to click the links and see a default state (which could also push me to the getting started docs).

### What I Did
1. Logged into Linkedin
2. Saw news about W&B
3. Got fucking excited
4. Signed up for W&B account through website
5. Scratched head, wondering what to do  (screenshot of landing page below)...
6. Found docs and figured it out
