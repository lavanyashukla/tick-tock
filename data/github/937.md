TITLE:
Add option to delete local run data after finished run

wandb, version 0.8.30
Python 3.8.2
Linux

### Description

I do extensive hyperparameter search, then my hard disk runs out of space. Expected behaviour: wandb be less hd intensive/clean up old run configs.

Suggested solution:

Add on option either as ENV or in init() that deletes the local run data after upload. 

I am aware of `wandb gc`, but I need something automatic.
