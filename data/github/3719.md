TITLE:
[Q] Moving runs between projects

BODY:
Hello, I have two projects: `a` and `b`

I would like to pull a run with ID `12345678` from `a` and push to `b` (because of archiving), is something like this possible? Or, is it possible to move a run from one project to another project using CLI or API?

I tried something but I did not figure out the right way to do so. First, I created a directory and initialized it with `wandb init -e me -p b .` Then I run `wandb pull -e me -p a 12345678` and got a dump of files associated with the run. However, it does not seem to create a "proper" wandb run with al the meta-data that other wandb runs usually have. So ` wandb sync -e me -p b` says `wandb: No runs to be synced.`
