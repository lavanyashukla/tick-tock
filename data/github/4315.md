### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
Hi! I've been using W&B without any problem for a while now but recently I noticed the command isn't being recognized. I've taken a look at [Issue #1969](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/1969) and have also tried the workaround `python -m wandb.cli` which doesn't work. I installed W&B using PIP.

Does anybody have any suggestions on what I could do? I've tried uninstalling and re-installing but it doesn't seem to work.

### Environment

WandB version: 0.13.3

OS: Linux

Python version: 3.7.9

Versions of relevant libraries: requests (2.28.1)
