[CLI]: sweep agent crashes during wandb.init()

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
The sweep agent crashes during wandb.init(), which is very probably caused by a server-side modification. This afternoon (13:00 - 15:00 CET) I was running a sweep as usual but when I wanted to start a very similar sweep later (after 18:30 CET) it didn't work anymore. Even running an exact copy of the pervious sweep with the same sweep.yaml, as well as code and no package updates, resulted in a crash. I therefore strongly suspect that it was caused by a server-side modification. 

From the traceback below, I investigated [sender.py](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/main/wandb/sdk/internal/sender.py#L626) and found that `history` is returns a list of dictionaries which does not need to be parsed again:
```python
history = json.loads(resume_status["historyTail"])
if history:
    history = json.loads(history[-1])
```

I don't know why this started to occur today and what the correct behavior would be, but removing the `json.loads` resolved the issue for me as a workaround. I don't have code to reproduce the issue, but I would assume that it occurs with any project using a history. Just to be sure, my minimal sweep.yaml looks like this but guess it won't change much:
```yaml
method: grid
metric:
  goal: maximize
  name: probe/student.max
parameters:
  enc:
    value: vgg11
program: dino.py
```

Thanks in advance and best wishes,
Felix
