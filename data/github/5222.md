TITLE:
[App]: Downloading CSV from web returns wrong aggregation

LABEL:
app

STATE:
closed

BODY:
### Current Behavior

In the web interface, when I click on an grouped graph [More actions]->[Download]->CSV, the provided data have several fields -- especially `__MIN` & `__MAX`. These are irrespective of the selected grouping in the graph (min/max; std dev; std err). 

I.e., irrespective of the graph grouping method, the downloaded file is always the same.

### Expected Behavior

I'd expect the returned file to contain the visualized data, which includes the selected aggregation method.
