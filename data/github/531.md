TITLE:
Syncing don't update existing runs but create new ones

### Description
Trying to sync runs launched on an offline compute server. 

Downloading runs from the server to my local machine via ssh and then running `wandb sync run-xxxxxx` to push them online.  

It works and push everything on wandb.com but instead of updating existing runs with new datas, it creates a new runs everytime. 

If I sync it x times I will get x similar runs (just longer steps) on the website.

### What I Did
Downloading runs from the server : `rsync -r --copy-links user@server:folder local_folder`

Syncing the downloaded runs (go to the folder and run) :` find wandb/run* -maxdepth 0 -type d -exec wandb sync {} \; > result.out `  so it update for all runs

Everything of this works but duplicate each of the runs. 
This issue is to allow the sync command to update existing runs

Thanks in advance
