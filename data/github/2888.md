[Q] Local controller use cases

I was wondering what exactly the use cases for the local controller are?

For background, I've been unsuccessfully trying to use a local controller to manage an offline sweep (grid search and no early stopping, so no dependencies between runs) on an HPC. Given the number of simultaneous processes I'm running, even though all the data logging is offline (using wandb.init(..., mode='offline')), the normal cloud-based sweeping still gets choked with 429 rate limit exceeded errors.

In the documentation, it suggests that I could use a local controller to manage this. But I found I was encountering the same issue. Digging through the code, it looks like the agents are still making the same API calls to the cloud regardless, and the controller is making its own calls as well. It appears that the controller takes over scheduling, but doesn't meaningfully reduce the burden.

Ideally, what I'm looking for is the ability to tie agents directly to the controller as fully offline agents.
