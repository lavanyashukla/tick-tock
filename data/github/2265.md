[Q]How to run self-hosting using Singularity?

LABEL:

BODY:
I want to run W&B locally, Could anybody give me an example for self-hosting using Singularity, not docker? I can't install docker on my computer because I'm not an administrator, but Singularity is availiable. I learn that Singularity could run docker image. So if possible, I want somebody to help me to use Singualrity to run self-hosting.
