TITLE:
[Feature]: wandb.plot.scatter() with error bars

BODY:
### Description

Some models try to estimate their own uncertainty while predicting the target. Or you have an ensemble of models and want to visualize the spread over members. Would be great if such uncertainty estimates could be visualized with `wandb.plot.scatter()`.

### Suggested Solution

Add a `y_err` kwarg to `wandb.plot.scatter()`.

### Alternatives

Can be done with `matplotlib` and `plotly` already.

### Additional Context
