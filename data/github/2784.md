[Q] Difference between `wandb.define_metric('loss', summary='min')` and `wandb.run.summary["loss"] = loss`

Hi wandb team, 

I've gone through the docs (specifically the [Summary Metrics](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/log) section), and am wondering what's the difference between `wandb.define_metric('loss', sumary='min')` and something like:
```
if loss < prev_loss:
    wandb.run.summary["loss"] = loss
```

Do they not both track the lowest loss?
