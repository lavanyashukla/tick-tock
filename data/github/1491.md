Error when Adding an artifact to a finished run

wandb version: 10.0.9
Python version: 3.6.12
OS: Win10

I'm running some evaluation on the model after the run is finished and trying to upload the results as an artifact attached to this run.

I'm creating an artifact as described in the docs: 
```
run = wandb.Api().run('maria_koristeleva/Test/<run_id>')
artifact = wandb.Artifact(name, type=type)
artifact.add_dir(path)
run.log_artifact(artifact)
```

But I'm getting an error: 
```
wandb: Adding directory to artifact (D:\GK-Pattern-Data-Gen\nn_pred_data_1000_tee_200527-14-50-42_regen_200612-16-56-43201113-17-27-49)... Done. 2.1s
Traceback (most recent call last):

    "Only existing artifacts are accepted by this api. "
ValueError: Only existing artifacts are accepted by this api. Manually create one with `wandb artifacts put`
```

Is this use-case supported?
