BODY:
Thanks for an amazing library and great work!

I'm wondering what would be the best way to plot a graphviz object in wandb?

I'm currently saving each graph (Digraph object in graphviz library) to a .png file and then log that as an image in wanbd.

Is there a better way to log graphs/graph objects?
