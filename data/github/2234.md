**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Runs crash randomly, we do checkpointing every 50 epochs, and currently it's not possible to specify that we want to resume at epoch 250. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add epoch/step parameter to wandb.init(resume=True), that will override any future logged steps.
