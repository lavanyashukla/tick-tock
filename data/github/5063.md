TITLE:
[CLI]: Issue with API api.runs() not providing all data

LABEL:

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
I am trying to get the data from each run/step in a certain project. In order to do so I am using wandb.Api().
My issue is that I can succesfully get an object with all of my runs but for most of the columns all of the values are NaN except the last one. This strikes me as a bit odd since that data is being plotted in the website: `https://wandb.ai/` so it should exist somewhere.
<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()

runs = api.runs("NAME_OF_PROJECT")
runs[0].history().val_f1
```

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
0           NaN
1           NaN
2           NaN
3           NaN
4           NaN
         ...   
135         NaN
136         NaN
