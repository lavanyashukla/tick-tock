TITLE:
Logging 'reward_mean' does not log it... weird

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
If I try to log a dict with a key `reward_mean` it does not go though (i.e. wandb graph is empty).
However, if I change the key name to `reward_meaaaan` - it works!
```
wandb.log({'reward_std': std, 'reward_mean': mean})
```
