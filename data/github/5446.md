TITLE:
[App]: Separating config and metrics

STATE:

### Current Behavior

In the Run Comparer, I would like it to only show the _config_ of the models (e.g. hyperparameters) so that I can compare differences between runs. The Run comparer seems to show every single logged metric, which is counterintuitive since config and metrics are different types of things.

More to the point, this seems to occur consistently in other places which might classify as a bug. In particular, in the run Overview page, the left side shows the _config_ and the right side shows the _metrics_ as appropriate (screenshot)

However, when I tried to download the config as raw dictionary data (pressing the "View Raw Data" button on the left), it exports not only the config but all the metrics again. I think this is a bug, unless it was an intentional design choice for some reason? This makes it very hard to do side-by-side comparisons of run hyperparameters which is a common use case

### Expected Behavior

Better separation of config and metrics where appropriate
- In the "View Raw Data" exports, the config export should only give the config and the metrics export should only give the metrics
- [feature request] in the Run Comparer, add a flag to only show config or metrics if desired
