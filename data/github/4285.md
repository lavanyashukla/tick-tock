[Q] Can i upload files to old finished runs?

Hi, I have a problem with checkpoints sometimes not being uploaded when i manually stop training with Ctrl+C multiple times (since it also interrupts file uploads).

The problem is that i cannot figure out a way to upload those checkpoint after the run is completed.
I have tried the following, all with no results:
```python
import wandb
api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("my_entity/my_project/my_run_id")
###### ***move relevant files to run.dir***
run.save()
run.finish()
```

```sh
wandb sync --id my_run_id wandb/my_run_path/ --include-synced
```

And also this:
```python
wandb.init(id="my_run_id")
wandb.save("path/to/checkpoints/last.ckpt.zip", base_path="/path/to/checkpoints", policy="now")
wandb.finish()
```
Which i have just found to create new run directories.


None of the methods i tried worked, and i can't find information by googling.

Anyone knows if uploading files to finished runs is at all possible, and if so, how?
