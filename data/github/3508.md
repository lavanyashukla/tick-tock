### Description

First of all, thanks a lot for providing such a great tool for logging. It really makes my research a lot easier.

Currently the metric values displayed in the web UI is always the summary value, by default the last value. However, usually the user is interested in the best metric that occured. The best is defined as either the min or max value that occured depending on the metric. 

To change the displayed value, the user has to write a couple of lines of code for each metric as shown in the documentary:

```
best_accuracy = 0
for epoch in range(1, args.epochs + 1):
test_loss, test_accuracy = test()
if (test_accuracy > best_accuracy):
    wandb.run.summary["best_accuracy"] = test_accuracy
    best_accuracy = test_accuracy
```
This means for each metric, one needs to add at least 4 lines of code, which is cumbersome in case of multi-objective metrics. For example, currently, I am tracking more than 10 metrics which would result in a lot of boilerplate code.

Additionally, this is useful for experiments, where the summary is not changed.

### Suggested Solution

Add a section to the single experiment view that displays a table of metrics with columns displaying min, max and last. 

Further, in the overview of all experiments, add to the sort menu a field to choose the value (i.e., min, max or last).
