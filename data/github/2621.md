TITLE:
Is there a way to make plots of intermittently logged media? [Q]

BODY:
I am training a model with some intermittent steps that get logged by wandb but do not contain certain data, so that media is set to "None" in python when it gets logged during those steps. This causes the entire plot on the wandb.ai webapp to display the message 

`Selected runs are not logging media for the key: parent_energy, but instead are logging type`

here is an example printout of the parent_energy value that I am referring to when I get it from the wandb api.run.history() in python

```
0       0.000000
1            NaN
2            NaN
3            NaN
4     -57.726136
         ...    
228          NaN
229          NaN
230          NaN
231          NaN
232          NaN
Name: parent_energy, Length: 233, dtype: float64
```

There are maybe 30 or so steps where the parent energy is logged out of 233 steps.

I would like to be able to log these intermittent steps during training, just like any other step, and be able to display a plot of the "parent_energy" on the steps where it does occur, is this possible?
