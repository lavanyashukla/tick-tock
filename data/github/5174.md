[Q] Logging Model Graph and Model Weights Update in Wandb

BODY:
Hello,

I am looking to log my model weights and graph in wandb, not as an artifact but more as a complete network and relevant model weights upgrade during the training. I am unable to find any relevant documents for this. I am using Pytorch Lightning. 

Is this supported? If yes, any relevant docs?
