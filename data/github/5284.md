TITLE:
[CLI]: Sweep doesn't freeze training script? Checking out branch changes code for subsequent runs?

### Describe the bug

I started a sweep and then checked out an old branch to work on a feature. The training script is different on this branch, and I noticed that new runs of the sweep were using the training script from this branch, and not the one that I initiated the script with. This was extremely unexpected behavior and ruined the sweep. I may have pause and restarted this run at some time as well but it is my expectation that a sweep would freeze the training script it was initiated with in order to ensure consistency across runs. 

Is there anything I could possibly have messed up or be doing wrong? I started the run with `wandb sweep --project my_project my_sweep.yaml`, started the agents with the standard command, and I triple checked that the logged scripts (in the code section of my run) are indeed different across different runs of the same sweep.
