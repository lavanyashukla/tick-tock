TITLE:
[Q] Is there a clean way to suppress unwatch warnings?

LABEL:

BODY:
`wandb` logs a warning every time we `.unwatch()` a model, spamming up our logs.

Is there a clean way to suppress this warning? 

```
**wandb**: WARNING [...] model has not been watched
```

## Our code
``` python
self.logger.experiment[0].unwatch(self.model)
```

## What we've tried:

``` python
with warnings.catch_warnings():
    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message="model has not been watched")
    self.logger.experiment[0].unwatch(self.model)
```

Thanks!
