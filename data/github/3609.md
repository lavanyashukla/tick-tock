TITLE:
[Feature]: Y axis scaling when score is close to zero

### Description

I am experimenting on a task where a low metric score is expected.
However, when the scores are close to zero, the Y axis always starts from zero instead of starting from the lowest score.

On the plots below, the f1 scores are close to zero. It is cluttered and hard to read.

### Suggested Solution

I think plots with low scores should also be scaled for better readability. Or at least an option to change the Y-axis.
Currently, I can drag with my mouse on the plot to zoom in, which kinda helps with the issue.
But then I can't see the whole plot at once.
