When I upgrade wandb-local from 0.28.0 to 0.31.0, I can't open the overview page of past runs. but I can open overview page of newer runs that are created after upgrading to 0.31.0. The error pages as follows:
<img width="1035" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39705429/231342831-7701495f-1cbc-4a1e-ab85-091f7c543502.png">
It is important to note that when I downgraded the image of wandb-local to 0.28.0, the URL of the overview was still accessible.
