[Q] Is it possible to load a run config without resuming a run?

I'm trying to load model weights using `wandb.restore` for a run from a while back, but for this I need to load the `wandb.config` to initialize a model with the right architecture before loading the weights. Is there a way to do that similar to `wandb.restore`, without using `wandb.init(resume=True, run_id=...)` ?
