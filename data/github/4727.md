TITLE:
[Feature]: Concatenate output (stdout/stderr) when resuming experiment

### Description

When resuming an experiment (with resume=True), currently the old output.log gets overwritten with the new output.
When I look at the log in the web ui, the old output is still displayed. However, if I download the log in the top right corner, I get the new log file. In "Files" on the web ui, there is also only the new output.log.

### Suggested Solution

When resuming a run, the content of the new output.log should be concatenated to the old log.
