### Description

There is a bug in the segmentation mask logging code. Specifically, [here](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/data_types.py#L1264).
The code is supposed to validate whether mask is a numpy integer array, but it calls `issubclass(mask.dtype.type, np.integer)`, while `mask` is a dictionary. I believe it should be `mask['mask_data']`? 

### Edit
I've changed this line in my local wandb source code, and it seems to be working now. Hopefully you'll fix this bug in the next version ðŸ˜„
