### Description

Wandb doesn't seem to recognize my git repo (anymore). When clicking on "View on Github" I get: "[...] we couldn't find a git commit for this particular run."

### What I Did
I should mention that my repo isn't initialized with wandb. Instead I do

``` wandb.init(dir=mkdtemp(), entity=entity, project=project, config=config) ```
