[Feature]: time per step

### Description

I would like to log the time per step (or the number or steps over time).

I'm working with images of different sizes and knowing how much it affect the training speed would be very useful in that case.

Maybe I didn't use the charts properly and you can do it, but I didn't find anyone asking or explaining how to do it so I'm making a feature request

### Suggested Solution

It seems that both the step and the time are automatically logged by wandb, but for some reason I cannot make a graph that shows both (either time per step or steps over time)
