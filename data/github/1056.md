Cannot add user to local wandb

LABEL:

Python version: 3.6.9
Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04

### Description

After setting up local wandb I go to `http://<host>:8080/admin/users` and try to add another user via "Add user" button.
I expect it to generate an invitation link for a new user.

### What I Did

When I press submit button, I get an error message:
```
only admins can use createUser()
```
There are two users in the table. The first one is the default user that has the same name as my ubuntu account. The second one is the user I created after I set up wandb client.
