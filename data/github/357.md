### Description

Calling writer.add_scalars(...) with a PyTorch TensorBoard SummaryWriter raises unexpected warnings.

This may be an issue with PyTorch rather than W&B, but wasn't sure.

### What I Did

Ran this python code:
```
import torch.utils.tensorboard
import wandb

writer = torch.utils.tensorboard.SummaryWriter()
wandb.init()
wandb.tensorboard.patch(tensorboardX=False, pytorch=True)

scalars = {
    'scalar_1': 1.0,
    'scalar_2': 2.0,
    'scalar_3': 3.0
}
writer.add_scalars('test', scalars, global_step=1)
```

Unexpected warnings:
```
wandb: WARNING Adding to old History rows isn't currently supported.  Step 0 < 1 dropping: {'scalar_2/global_step': 0, '_timestamp': 1559366850.7236722}
wandb: WARNING Adding to old History rows isn't currently supported.  Step 0 < 1 dropping: {'scalar_3/global_step': 0, '_timestamp': 1559366850.724994}
```
The global_step should be 1 for all of the scalars, but it's only being set to 1 for scalar_1. Then when it tries to add scalar_2 and scalar_3, which are given a global_step of 0 for some reason, it raises these warnings saying that old history data can't be added.
