TITLE:
[Feature] Kill/stop/pause selected agents 

LABEL:
feature_request,c:sweeps,stale

STATE:
open

BODY:
It would be nice to have some mechanism to either **stop** or **pause each agents** directly from the sweep control panel.
For example, we have started some sweep on 4 GPUs with 4 agents. At some point we need to free only two GPUs, but we don't want to completely interrupt our sweep and run it further with 2 remaining GPUs. After some time, we could start new agents on these GPUs ones they are available again.
Possible workaround would be to _pause_ the sweep, kill the processes assigned to these agents, and then continue that sweep. Personally, I find this workaround somewhat cumbersome in the day to day usage. 
It would be nice to hear of some better solution or to see this feature in future releases :)
