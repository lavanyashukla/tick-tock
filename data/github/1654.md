TITLE:
Show error for crashed runs in UI

BODY:
**Problem or Use Case**
Often times, I'm running a dozen processes on my AWS EC2 server, and since wandb auto-restarts after failure, it's hard to locate the backtrace of the error. While there are disk logs of wandb, I'd have to match the failed run to it, which is tedious work.

**Suggested Solution**
Upload the logs, or at least the last 500 lines of it to the wandb UI.
