TITLE:
Onboarding: Add "entity=teamname" to the project onboarding page

LABEL:
bug,onboarding

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I followed instructions under
https://app.wandb.ai/cybertronai/moonscrub

which is a team project I created

But the resulting project got created under
https://app.wandb.ai/yaroslavvb/moonscrub

Do you I need to do something special to get the logging to go under a team project?
