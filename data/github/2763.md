TITLE:
[App] Project page table not showing any columns and width not adjustable

**Describe the bug**
The table on my [project's overview page](https://wandb.ai/prashant-pand3y/uncertainty-bone-seg?workspace=user-prashant-pand3y) is not showing any columns, despite having selected all columns to show. The width of the table is also not adjustable as it used to be, which is causing all my plots to be squished in the right pane. 

Does not seem to be an issue for my other projects.
