TITLE:
[App]: Images logged to files, but not visible in workspace

LABEL:
app

STATE:
closed

BODY:
### Current Behavior

When logging images, I am not able to view them in the workspace, even though the files are available.

### Expected Behavior

An image panel should pop up automatically (the same code was working previously), and if not, I should be able to add a panel for images.

### Steps To Reproduce

On the python side, I'm logging images with a line like

`wandb.log({'images': wandb.Image(image_grid)}, step=iteration, commit=True)`

for which I encounter the problems described.

See the difference between https://wandb.ai/dyunis/deq_diffusion/runs/zv2phncl?workspace=user-dyunis (working) and https://wandb.ai/dyunis/deq_diffusion/runs/c85nrhug?workspace=user-dyunis (not working)

### Screenshots

Here are the files in the web app for the working run:

Here is the workspace with a "Media" section:

And here is the ability to add a new panel with images:

Now for a run that does not seem to be displaying correctly, here are the same screenshots, for the media:

For the workspace, now missing a "Media" section by default:

And the inability to add a panel with images to the workspace:

### Environment

OS: macOS Monterey 12.6.2

Browsers: Safari 15.6.1, Chrome 109.0.5414.87

Version: wandb 0.13.9


### Additional Context

https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/3936 seems like the same issue, but for video, but there hasn't been any activity on that for many months.

Thanks for this wonderful software, it's really invaluable in my day-to-day!
