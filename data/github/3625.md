Exception: The wandb backend process has shutdown

Hi everyone,

I have been using the WandB logger on Pytorch Lightning for a while now, and it keeps on randomly crashing with the following error: "Exception: The wandb backend process has shutdown".

I launch the same script several times on the same machine (same docker container and same gpu). Inside the script, I create a pytorch lightning model and I use the weight and biases logger to monitor the results. Here is the code:

**wandb_logger = pl.loggers.WandbLogger(
reinit=True,
settings=wandb.Settings(start_method="fork"),
project = "Misinformation_Detection",
entity = "misinfo_detection",
save_dir = os.path.join(project_folder,"out","training_logs","wandb"),)**

In addition, inside the same script, I need to instantiate and delete the same model several times. For this reason, at the end of every run I do the following:

**wandb_logger.experiment.finish()**

Am I doing something wrong?

Thanks. Best,

Giorgio
