TITLE:
Support Hydra in sweeps

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
It would be great if applications configured to run with hydra could be used in sweeps. Right now the problems is that when expanding `args`, wandb prepends double dashes, as stated in documentation

> ${args}: Expanded arguments in the form --param1=value1 --param2=value2

Hydra would require the expansion to be

> param1=value1 param2=value2

I think this could be easily added as an option in sweep configuration.
