TITLE:
[App]: some columns are displayed as null after offline runs are synced 

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

### Current Behavior

When I finished some offline runs and synced them into my account, some columns of some runs in the table mode cannot be displayed in the Web app. Sometimes all the metric columns within a certain offline run are null (e.g., some lines masked as orange in Screenshot-1), but sometimes just several columns are null (e.g., some lines masked as blue in Screenshot-1).  However, the graphs of these runs may be normally displayed (e.g., the line masked with orange in Screenshot-2).

This issue cannot be fixed by re-synchronizing these offline runs.

Moreover. when I access the attributes of these columns with ```wandb.Run``` API as following:
```
import wandb
api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("USER/PROJECT/RUN_ID")
summary = {}
for key, value in run.__dict__["_attrs"].items():
    print(key, value)
```
the values of these columns can be correctly printed. So I guess it is a bug of the Web app.

### Expected Behavior

All columns in the table mode of offline runs can be normally displayed after sync.
