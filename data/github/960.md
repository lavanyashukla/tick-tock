### Description

I need to run wandb in offline mode on Kaggle kernels with no internet access. But whenever I run `wandb.init()` it asks for login key. Why would I need to login in offline mode? I just want the log files. Even if I put a key, it requires the internet to authenticate which is not possible with no internet access.
