Missing epochs in metric data

I recently ran an experiment using WandbCallback where training of a keras model runs in two phases, each looping for 30 epochs.  Somehow though I only ended up with 58 steps recorded in the [run page ](https://app.wandb.ai/hammerlab/celldom/runs/zhkapsu3) (but there are definitely 60 in the logs and keras model histories).  

In general, are there fairly loose guarantees around persistence, or might be this have something to do with running two separate training loops?
