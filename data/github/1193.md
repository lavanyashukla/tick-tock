TITLE:
artifacts do not clean .cache after upload

### Description

Artifacts upload in wandb runs doesn't seem to clean up cache files after itself properly. 

As I work with my ML experiments, the `C:\Users\<Username>\.cache\wandb\artifacts`  folder grows up to the point that it exhausts all the free space on my drive (up to 50 Gb). After this point, I have to clean it manually to resume my work. 

The size of all artifacts to be uploaded within a single run is about 5Gb (counting all the versions of the same files), which is definitely less that the .cache folder size when I discover the problem

### Additional errors

At times I get these errors at the end of the run: 

```
C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\wandb\compat\tempfile.py:64: UserWarning: Couldn't remove temp directory C:\Users\Maria\AppData\Local\Temp\tmp7apg1zqmwandb

```

Which seems related to cleaning-up but point to a different Temp folder that DO NOT have this problem of size growing
