TITLE:
How to use API in offline mode to access local log files?

LABEL:

STATE:
open

BODY:
I would like to use the wandb API at the end of the training process to output results, trainign arguments and history. Because the Run object in wandb_logger.experiment is missing some information, I need to use the API to load the Run object after training (See https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/3493)

If I am connected (wandb on), after training I can do:

```
    wandb_logger.experiment.finish() # I seem to need this sometimes
    run_path = wandb_logger.experiment.path
    read_access_run = wandb.Api().run(run_path)
 ```

And then use `read_access_run.config`, `read_access_run.summary`, `read_access_run.history()`

It I am offline (wandb off), however, as I will be often when testing code, I have the following error:
```
ValueError: Could not find run <Run yyy/xxx/16gi3ac0 (not found)>
wandb.errors.error.CommError: Could not find run <Run yyy/xxx/16gi3ac0 (not found)>
```

I would like to access things like training history even if I am offline. What shall I do?
