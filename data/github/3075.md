[App] Bug: scalar chart shows inaccurate MIN/MAX because it uses only the last logged value

**Describe the bug**
I created a scalar chart that should show the MAX value of a logged value. However, it seems to show the last value of that metric.

Here's the formula from the scalar chart, clearly showing that I selected to show the MAX value.

However, the MAX value logged in wandb is around 0.46 rather than 0.34. This makes me believe there's a bug that wandb shows the last value in scalar charts.

I confirm that scalar charts use only the last logged value by showing a MIN/MAX range. The MAX value should be around 85.
