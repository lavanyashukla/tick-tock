wandb 0.8.0 stops reporting by first eval

### Description

I'm fine-tuning a model with a custom dataset using the TensorFlow Object Detection API. All data and metadata is stored and saved on Google Cloud Storage (GCS), incl. the TensorBoard metadata/logs. Since version 0.8.0, reporting stops after a little while - seemingly when the model is being evaluated.

### What I Did

`!pip install wandb`
`!wandb login KEY`

A modified `model_main.py` is then executed:

```
!python object_detection/model_main_wandb.py \
  --pipeline_config_path="${CONFIGS_DIR}/${PIPELINE_FILE}" \
  --model_dir="${TRAIN_DIR}"
```

Which runs this method before training starts:

```
def wandb_init():
  # Get pipeline config in a W&B friendly format
  pipeline_config = pipeline_pb2.TrainEvalPipelineConfig()
  with tf.gfile.GFile(FLAGS.pipeline_config_path, "r") as f:
    proto_str = f.read()
    text_format.Merge(proto_str, pipeline_config)

  wandb_config = json_format.MessageToDict(message=pipeline_config)
  wandb.init(config=wandb_config, tensorboard=True)
```

It does report files that it's unable to access on GCS, but that also happened before and it still worked: `wandb: gs://BUCKET/v1/runs/RUN_ID/eval_0/events.out.tfevents.1558516485.622e141833f4 is a cloud storage url, can't save file to wandb.` (for 0.7.3 - let me know if I should reproduce for 0.8.0, but they are similar)

This works without issues on 0.7.3 (I've now pinned this version to confirm), even with the error/warning above, except for some files being unavailable on W&B, e.g. the checkpoints, but I was fine with just the metrics. I can see a "TensorBoard Watcher" was introduced in 0.8.0 - perhaps it's related to this?

Let me know if you need some more details from me.
