TITLE:
[Feature]: Allow to disable code saving from tracking code

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
### Description

Currently, a user can enable code saving from the UI settings and Wandb will send the entry-point code to the tracking service.

If Wandb logging is integrated in other applications, it would be crucial for app developers to disable code saving. Allowing this feature to be enabled from user side, instead of from app developer side, can have bad repercussions.

### Suggested Solution

Allow to force-disable any code saving from application code.
