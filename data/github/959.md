### Description

Hi,

Right now, if you want to download saved files with the cli you have to do something like 
```
wandb pull -e username -p projectname run_id
```
It would be nice to be able to use the shortcut name (e.g. vibrant-eon-807) so you don't have to look up the run_id which is only visible in the URL (https://app.wandb.ai/[username]/[project_name]/runs/[run_id]/overview). 

Something like this would be a lot more user-friendly:
```
wandb pull -e username -p projectname vibrant-eon-807
```

Thanks
