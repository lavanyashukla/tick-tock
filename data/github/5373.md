### Current Behavior

In the README, on clicking on the   "On-Prem/Bare Metal" version under the W&B Hosting Options, the url redirects to https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/setup/on-premise-baremetal which is not present on the website

### Expected Behavior

I think it should be directed to https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/hosting/how-to-guides/basic-setup#persistence-and-scalability

1. Change the link in the README
