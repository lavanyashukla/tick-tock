### Current Behavior

I am trying to measure GPU usage when training a Keras model (in addition to calculating GFLOPS), the first error is that it cannot calculate GFLOPS and the second error is that it only reports irrelevant system information, and not GPU information.

I need to measure GPU utilization in addition to GFLOPS to compare some models.
