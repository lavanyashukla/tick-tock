TITLE:
[App]: Multiple tables are not merged into a single table

LABEL:
app

STATE:
closed

BODY:
### Current Behavior

I log a table with 3 columns: 2 image columns, and a number column.
I log this table once every 4 batches (to the same key), yet results are only shown for the first time the table is logged.



### Expected Behavior

I see rows for every timestep the table is logged (not just the 1st timestep):

Table generation code:

```
def make_table(*, x_0, x_t, t):
    table = wandb.Table(columns=["x_0", "x_t", "t"])
    for x_0_, x_t_, t_ in zip(x_0, x_t, t):
        x_0_pil = TVF.to_pil_image(x_0_)
        x_t_pil = TVF.to_pil_image(x_t_)
        table.add_data(wandb.Image(x_0_pil), wandb.Image(x_t_pil), t_.item())
    return table
```

### Steps To Reproduce

_No response_

### Screenshots

I've logged the table (underneath this same key) multiple times, yet only results from the 1st `wandb.log` call show up:
