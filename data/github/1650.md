**Problem or Use Case**
The sorting mechanism allow for multiple sorting fields, but I couldn't figure out the sorting logic behind it. It seems like it just picks one of the fields to sort by.

I would expect that it would function as a secondary, third, etc. sorting.
E.g. first sorting by the first field, and then within the equal values of the first field, it would sort by the second field, etc.

Was it supposed to work this way? if not, can this feature be added? It would be super useful.
