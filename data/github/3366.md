[Feature]: Stop Training from wandb API

BODY:
### Description

We'd like to be able to stop a training run from wandb from the API. 

### Suggested Solution

Add a button to the web UI "stop run" and add a flag to each run "stop requested", expose via API to set this flag. Every time a wandb function is called for that run (ie. training logging) it checks if "stop requested" is true, and if yes terminates the current process (or raise an exception that can be handled by the training code, ideally make it an option if it raises an exception or just terminates that code).
