**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When I'm working on multiple projects, I would like to use multiple W&B teams/accounts. But the `wandb login client_key` sets the client key globally and does not allow it to change inside directories. 

In contrast, `git` allows having local config files that contain the username and account, which gets recorded for every commit. 

I'd love to see this feature in W&B.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Instead of setting the client key globally, a local `.wandb` folder can be used to set a local key, just like how `git` does.
