TITLE:
Updating config with ArgumentParser removes args from the parser Namespace

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
I'm using a yaml-based sweep to run a script in which I use ArgumentParser. I followed the config [instructions](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/config) and called `update()`:

```
parser = ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('--foo', type=int)
args = parser.parse_args()
wandb.init(project="bar")
wandb.config.update(args)
print(args.foo)
```

In this example `foo` is controlled by the sweep, but I also have other arguments not controlled by the sweep (which take on default values), and I'd like for all arguments to be recorded under wandb's config. But in that last line, trying to access `args.foo` results in: `AttributeError: 'Namespace' object has no attribute 'foo'`. I get warnings about how the Config value `foo` was locked by 'sweep', which I understand and expect, but for some reason wandb removes the conflicting config values from the Namespace passed to `update()`, instead of just leaving them be. My workaround is to turn the args into a dict and copy them like so: `wandb.config.update(copy.copy(vars(args)))`

**Expected behavior**
Warnings are given that I'm updating a config controlled by a sweep, but those arg values remain in the `args` Namespace to be accessed by the training script like normal.

**Operating System**
