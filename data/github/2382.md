TITLE:
[Q] Custom number of columns in each Panel

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I plot 3 images, each image contains two kinds of masks (Prediction, Ground Truth).
When it was display in wandb.ai, the size of them is too small because the columns in panel here is 8 automatically. I need to go into "Edit Panel" and set the number of columns to 3 for better display.

So are there any ways to set the columns of the panels when I log them in python? 

Thanks
