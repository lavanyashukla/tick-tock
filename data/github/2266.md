TITLE:
[Feature] Option to fetch history rows with undefined keys

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I don't see an efficient way to get a history object for a number of runs where the desired keys might not be available in some of the runs.

One option is to fetch all keys and filter locally, which is especially impractical for media types which I don't need in many situations. An alternative approach requires an accurate knowledge of run/key mapping and building from smaller queries. Unfortunately, I have not found an easy way to get this kind of information through the API.

I would like to have an option to fetch a filtered view (through `history` and `scan_history`) without discarding rows with missing values. Or at least an option to `ignore_keys` so that at least some of the columns can be excluded before being sent.
