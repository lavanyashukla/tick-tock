TITLE:
[Q] Logging metrics for previous steps / Resetting a run's step

BODY:
As far as I can tell, the default behaviour of wandb is that you can only log metrics forwards, not backwards. That is, if a metric is logged for step _t_, logs made for step _t-1_ are ignored.

Is it possible to overcome this? Specifically, I want to have two distinct training runs (with non-overlapping metrics other than what wandb logs by default such as device-related measurements) and log them in the same wandb run, so I would need to log metrics for steps 0-100, and then reset the run so that I could log new metrics, again for steps 0-100.
