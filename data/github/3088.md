TITLE:
[Feature] Organize simulation in more complex subfolders' structure

LABEL:
feature_request,c:grouping

STATE:
open

BODY:
**messy simulations' list**
Often one has to perform several runs/simulation related to a given study. It'd be very useful to be able to organize them in subfolder into the dashboard

**Proposed Solution: specify a path in the `wandb.init`**
It'd be very practical and intuitive to  add an argument in `wandb.init` , similar to the (existing) `group` where it is possible to express a path (instead of a simple group's name) where to sync the simulation's result  

**Existing Solution: `job_type`**
It is already possible to organize runs belonging to a group into sub-groups with `job_type` argument.
On the other hand a more flexible feature, as the one proposed, would, in my opinion, further improve this aspect and make the organizations of different simulations more easy

**More details**
In this [discussion](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/3077) the issue had been discussed more in details; take a look if the above explanaition is not clear. 
I'd be happy to clarify any doubt as well, so don't hesitate to ask ;)
