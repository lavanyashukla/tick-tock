[Q] how sync deleted run

Hi, I use wandb to log my training logs. I made it run in offline mode by calling `wandb offline`, and then I synced the log by calling `wandb sync`. Unfortunately, I deleted the run in my dashboard. However, the training continues, and when I try to sync this run again, I get the following:
```bash
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: run XXX/XXX/run_id was previously created and deleted; try a new run name (<Response [409]>)
```
How can I sync my log again? Because it's still running, can I recover the deleted one and sync it again? Thanks! :)
