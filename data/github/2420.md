TITLE:
[CLI] Permission denied: '/users' on remote cluster from `wandb agent`

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I'm trying to run a sweep on a remote cluster via SLURM by executing the `wandb agent` command within a SLURM script. I'm getting a `PermissionError` because some `wandb` default directory is set to my user's home directory, but I'm unable to access `/users` via SLURM. I've tried setting `WANDB_DIR`, `WANDB_CONFIG_DIR`, and `WANDB_CACHE_DIR` environment variables before importing `wandb`, but this hasn't fixed it. `wandb` must have some other default path set to my home directory -- what could this be?

wandb version: 0.11.0
Python version: 3.7.6

Here's the full stack trace:
