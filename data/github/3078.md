TITLE:
[Q] Sharing results with WandB in double-blind review

LABEL:

BODY:
I would like to share training runs with WandB in a paper submission which will be reviewed double blind. I see a few issues which I cannot easily circumvent: 

1. 'wandb-metadata.json' contains the 'username', 'host' and 'executable` keys, which can easily leak identity
2. errors/warnings in the 'log' can leak system paths, which can contain your usrname. (This can be disabled in the code, though)
3. In the overview the author's profile is visible, which can only be circumvented by making a new fresh account?

Do you have any suggested solutions to the issues above, and maybe things I've missed on the feasibility of sharing results in a double-blind review?
