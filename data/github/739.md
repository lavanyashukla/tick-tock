TITLE:
Better capture of non python launch commands

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Our cli is designed to capture the command for `python ...`, but often fails to capture the proper calls in more complex dev setup. 

This particular ticket was created from an issue with a horovod interaction.



From Chenyu Ho:

Hi, our group uses horovod to train models.
wandb tries to save the command, but is only able to capture the python part.
Is there a better way to save the full mpi commands we run?
one way I can come up with is to pass the full command as an argument and save it in wandb.config
