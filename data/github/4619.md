### Describe the bug

Hi,

When I try to log grayscale (one channel) videos through the wandb logger on pytorch lightning, I get a weird behavior. The video is getting duplicated 9 times and becomes RGB. This doesn't happen when I manually duplicate the channel dimension to have 3 channels. 

You can see below what happens when I manually make it RGB on the left, and what happens when I just input the video in grayscale on the right (timeXchannelsXheightXwidth).
