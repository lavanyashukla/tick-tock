TITLE:
[Q] Is there a way to launch and log multiple runs and sync at the end?

LABEL:

BODY:
I am launching multiple runs within a single script by setting reinit=True when initializing wandb and calling run.finish() at the end according to the documentation here:
https://docs.wandb.ai/library/init#how-do-i-launch-multiple-runs-from-one-script

However, each call to run.finish() takes around 3 secs on my machine, which is inefficient as my runs end pretty quickly (each run logs between 500-1000 scalar values in about 5 secs), and I am launching hundreds of them. So I was wondering if there's any other way to do it more efficiently?

I think I can also use offline mode and sync at the end, but I don't know how to do it in the script itself (not manually with the command line).
