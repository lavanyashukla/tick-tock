TITLE:
[Feature]: Allow for histograms to be displayed in project view

LABEL:

### Description

Currently histograms that are logged to WandB are only shown in the run view itself, and not when viewing this run on a project page. Since this makes it difficult to compare runs - one has to click on each run to see it's histograms - it would be nice if the histograms were also showing on the project page.

### Suggested Solution

I understand that it is difficult/impossible to display histograms from multiple runs in one graph. Maybe we can have the histograms only displaying the most recently selected run, or allow for a dropdown menu on the histogram to choose which of the runs that are currently being displayed we want to see on the histogram (this could even be a global setting to allow for a more qualitative user experience).
