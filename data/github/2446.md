[App] Logging image tables

Hi all, I'm trying to log images as tables and have the following simple example which isn't working with PyTorchLightning WandbLogger. Just wondering if I'm doing anything obviously wrong. Thanks in advance.

```python
logger = WandbLogger("DINO", "/kaggle/working/logs/", project="DINO")

rows = []
for _ in range(5):
    idx = np.random.choice(10000, 5)
    rows.append([wandb.Image(files[i]) for i in idx])
columns = [str(i) for i in range(5)]
table = wandb.Table(data=rows, columns=columns)

logger.experiment.log({"test table 2": table})
```

wandb version: `'0.10.26'`

On the wandb page, all I see is this (stating "Weave expressions are limited to 25 runs. Of the first 25 runs selected, none have data to visualize for the provided expression."):
