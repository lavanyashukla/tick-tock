[Q] Programmatically set color of run

BODY:
Hello,

Following the doc, I was not able to find whether or not it is possible to set the color of a run programmatically: https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/app/features/panels/run-colors. From what I understand, the colors are locally scoped so I guess this is not an option?

Can you confirm this? If so, would you be willing to add this to the api by specifying the pair (scope, run_id)?

Thanks in advance!
