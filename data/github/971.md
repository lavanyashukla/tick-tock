### Description

Using the `wandb.log()` call, I have been sending data for param tracking of the models I'm currently working on, and I get this in the Dashboard:

I think this is partially user error, but then there are a few scenarios when non-numeric data is passed to W&B.

**Scenario 1:** currently it's not plotted and we get the above messages
**Scenario 2:** user can be warned about it in a separate tab (list of errors/warnings tab and/or logs) and not show them at all in the dashboard
**Scenario 3:** not flag them as error/warning but rather collect them and show some sort of a histogram or matrix chart plotted against time (just like the other metrics shown in the dashboard). This is super useful as we may have non-numeric data that we want to see the spread and frequency across our training, I can already think of its use with NLP and related topics.
**Scenario 4:** combine the above in different forms and abstract them behind flags or settings so the user can toggle to the kind of behaviour they want, and the default should be some warning in the logs or in the dashboard or both.

### What I Did

I removed the calls that involved sending non-numeric data to W&B and instead passed those via the `wandb.config` calls and then started getting this, which is desired:

Although would be good to have the scenarios discussed as mentioned in the above section.
