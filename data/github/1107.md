TITLE:
"null" not working when filtering the runs

BODY:
This issue is related to W&B UI.

When some config option is logged as null (or none in python), the table filtering does not work with it properly. For example, no matter what filter you set on that property, you won't be able to see the runs with "null" value of that config option.
