TITLE:
[App]: Null value of a metric is plotted in a scatter chart

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

Some of my runs have logged a `<null>` values for certain metrics (most probably, `wandb.log` was called with a `np.nan`). These values nevertheless produce a point in a scatter plot chart I created in project's Overview tab (see screenshots, the top-left point). There is no tooltip for the point on mouse-over, but a double-click redirects me to the run's Charts page.

### Expected Behavior

If at least one coordinate is `<null>`, the point is not displayed at all in the scatter plot chart.

### Steps To Reproduce

I did not try to reproduce the bug.

### Screenshots

Note that the point stays in the top-left corner after changing the axes limits.
Note that one coordinate appears as the maximum display value, and the other appears as the minimum, while both are `<null>`.
