[CLI]: api.history() producing null values

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
When uploading an offline run to the server from the CLI using wandb sync (possibly when setting my own --id I can't remember) the run uploads successfully and I can see all the logged metrics in the WebUI. 

However when I export the run using the wandb.Api() the dataframe contains only null values for certain metrics (in fact the columns do not appear even in the df only in the exported excel file but this is likely a pandas quirk). Interestingly for the problematic metics there is a single entry in the excel file where the values are not null (see attached)

Possibly related to #4420 #4421, my run is `/luchayward/kpconv/runs/2bruuf2r/` if someone from the team is curious.
