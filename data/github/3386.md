TITLE:
[CLI]: Disabling code saving not working as intended

### Describe the bug

According to documentation, one can set `WANDB_DISABLE_CODE` environment variable to True or use `wandb.init(save_code=False)` to disable code saving. However, this seems to be overwritten by the user setting in the UI to enable code saving. 

Even if I set both the environment variable, and the init flag, but enable it in the UI under settings, the code is saved.
This should not be possible to be overwritten by a user.
