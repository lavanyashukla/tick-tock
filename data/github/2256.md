**Describe the bug**
A picture says more than a thousand words. 

The position and range of the vertical boxplot is plotted wrong. In the first screenshot, the range of the green plot is visible.

**To Reproduce**
It's not clear to me why it happens.
- Originally the issue was on two plots. I managed to fix one by deleting it and recreating it. 
- Reloading of the page does not help
- Maybe a numeric issue due to small numbers?
- Happens only in vertical box plots
