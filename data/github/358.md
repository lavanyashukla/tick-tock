TITLE:
Feature request: An option to invert the y-axis log scale for visualizations.

LABEL:
enhancement

STATE:
closed

BODY:
When a visualization plots a value that approaches the bottom of the graph (such as loss), enabling the y-axis log scale helps by showing more detail in the lower values, but when the visualization plots a value that approaches the top of the graph (such as accuracy), enabling the y-axis log scale squashes the values at the top, making them less readable.

It would be nice to have an option to invert the y-axis log scale so that values towards the top would be expanded.

This screenshot shows how enabling the y-axis log scale helps with the loss, but makes the accuracy harder to read.
