[CLI]: Save media images with leading zeros in local wandb dir to preserve logging order

### Describe the bug

Currently, media logged to `wandb` appear to be saved locally in something like the following format: `<wandb_dir>/<run_id>/files/media/images/<media_name>_<step>_<media_id>.png`.

The issue is that the `<step>` part of the file name is just a plain integer. This means that when ordered alphabetically (as is the default in most systems), the files are not in the order they are logged. For example, here is a snippet of one of my media folders:

```
all_100_cc5ef7a50d65b4c5dacf.png
all_107_4d6f8dd22f9daf443f04.png
all_114_5937fbc5a3ac33865580.png
all_1_1ab59e95bf4affa60ed0.png  
all_121_71cf4ab3144011fc22dc.png
all_128_7f916240b5c21cd4f8af.png

all_163_508c194af1c359498240.png
...
```

It would be useful if the files were ordered in the same order that they are logged (ie with increasing `step`). This would mean that you could easily create a gif showing the evolution of a figure during training (this is also possible with the incorrect order as above, but is more irritating and would probably need regex to extract the step counter part and then order based on that). Creating an animation over `step` is not supported by the W&B web app, so this one-line change to the library would be a quick way to make it possible for users to do this manually.

I suggest adding leading zeros to the `step` part of the filename to ensure they are stored in the correct order.
