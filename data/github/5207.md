TITLE:
[Feature]: Sweep then run an agent

### Description

There are many cases where I want to start a sweep and then immediately run a sweep agent in the main process.  Right now I have to go
```
wandb sweep config.yaml
```
Then look at the output and then go
```
wandb agent <agent_name>/<sweep_id>
```

This is a pain to do, and makes it harder to create shell scripts which automatically do this step.

### Suggested Solution

Add on a new option to the `sweep` to start an agent.  e.g. so I can do something like
```
wandb sweep --start_agent config.yaml
```
and then is just like I had first created the sweep then next started an agent.  Just as with `wandb agent` the process doesn't return until the agent is done.
