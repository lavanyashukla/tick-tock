### Description

When using newline character "\n" in the caption of `wandb.Image`, the newline is not displayed in the interface.

### What I Did

I used a command such as `wandb.Image(sample_image, caption='line1\nline_2')` and no newline was displayed.

On below example, I expected to have the ground truth and prediction on 2 separate lines.
