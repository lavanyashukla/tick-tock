### Description

In the run summary there is a field called "Git repository", when cloning a private repository with https the command has the following structure:

`git clone https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@github.com/REPO.git`

wandb will save this command including the PASSWORD in plain text, if the run is public... you see the issue.
