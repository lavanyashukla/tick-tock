**Describe the bug**

First time W&B user here. I added the `WandbLogger` to my PyTorch-Lightning project using the default settings, ie. `Trainer(logger=WandbLogger())`. Note that I'm resuming training from a checkpoint (didn't use W&B logger before).

I'm getting lots of warnings like `wandb: WARNING Step must only increase in log calls.  Step 47 < 270952; dropping {'loss': -2.309272527694702}` and no metrics are reported. Other data like GPU utilisation is collected correctly.
