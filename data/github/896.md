TITLE:
Expanding groups in the table breaks after deleting runs

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**How to replicate :**
- Have multiple runs under various filters.
- Open Table view.
- Expand a specific run's branch of the tree fully.
- Delete that run.

**Issue :** If you try to expand some other branch now, it does expand and also doesn't show any other runs.

**Temporary fix:** Refresh the Webpage.
