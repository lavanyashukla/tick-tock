[Feature]: Include logs from multiple processes in one run

### Description

I have a training setup that involves multiple processes running simultaneously (i'm doing RL, so I have processes playing a game, a process training the model, processes loading data, etc). I would like to collect metrics from all of them, and be able to see them all in the same wandb run. I don't think this is possible currently, afaik? I've seen y'all suggest calling `wandb.init()` in each process and grouping them all together, but that seems awfully messy.
