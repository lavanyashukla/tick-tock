[CLI]: media/ folder does not sync when there are special characters in the file path

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

Images in /media folder are not synchronised if the folder run name includes the characters "[" or "]".

Images are saved locally in the media/ folder. Using wandb sync with various flags has no effect, the client is convinced there are no media files to sync up. However, artifacts with files in the /media folder get synchronised properly (for example a table with images stored in the columns).

I also noticed that in the run summary page, the categories below the Hostname are missing (except the Wandb CLI version category).

Happy to share runs demonstrating this privately if needed.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
No exceptions thrown. Sync message looks like this
```shell
wandb: Synced 6 W&B file(s), 0 media file(s), 514 artifact file(s) and 0 other file(s)
```
