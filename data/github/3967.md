TITLE:
[Feature]: Automatically group metrics into windows in the GUI

### Description

I would like a way of designating a metric when I log it to appear in the Hidden Windows section*.  

It is annoying that if I push to a new project I have to go through and sift out all of the metrics that I want to store but not show. 

(or maybe even a separate window section.)

### Suggested Solution

something like `Wandb.log(METRIC, hidden=True)` (where the default is `hidden=False`).  Then the GUI sorts metrics based on the `hidden` flag.

### Alternatives

Ideally, there would be a `metric_group` field, that allowed metrics to be displayed in separate GUI windows automatically. 

Alternatively, maybe if one could copy the GUI config from one project to another?  If there is a setting for a particular metric in the GUI config then it is applied to the new project.  

### Additional Context

We use projects for sorting experiments to keep individual projects smaller and easier to use.  I realise this is maybe not the most common modus operandi, however...
