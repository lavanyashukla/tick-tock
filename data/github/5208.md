TITLE:
[Feature]: Allow environment variables in the sweep yaml file

LABEL:
feature_request,c:sweeps

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Description

There are cases when I want to change a single value in a shell script and then run one or more sweeps.  This comes up in creating replication packages.

I would love to be able to refer to environment variables within the yaml specification.

### Suggested Solution

For example, lets say I had an environment variable `export EXPERIMENT_LAYERS="4"`

Then I would love to be able to write the config files like
```yaml
program: investment_euler.py
method: grid
parameters:
  model.layers:
    value: $(EXPERIMENT_LAYERS}
```
with whatever interpolation you have in mind.  e.g. `${ENV:EXPERIMENT_LAYERS}` etc.

If this feature is already there, my apologies, I just didn't see it in the docs.
