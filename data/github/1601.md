TITLE:
Shut up moviepy

LABEL:
bug,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
When using wandb.Video, moviepy prints
```
Moviepy - Writing video /tmp/tmpqt0fstd9wandb-media/nzsn7ktn.mp4
Moviepy - Done !
```
It also prints the following warning (don't know if this is wandb or moviepy)
```
WARNING:root:Converting video data to uint8
```
I'm a sucker for a clean terminal output so I would like to suppress all of these. I can of course add code to do this but it's a bit messy. Is there a silent flag for this, or something similar?

I have the latest wandb and moviepy versions on pip, btw.

Thanks a lot in advance.
