### Current Behavior

I am running a RCNN model from LayoutParser (https://github.com/Layout-Parser/layout-model-training) and trying to use WandB for model experimentation. But WandB does not showed any metrics or graph after the training end? How can I fix this?

### Expected Behavior

Expected to see graph of metrics like I run Yolov5 before

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Open google colab
2. Git clone https://github.com/Layout-Parser/layout-model-training
3. Setup WandB
4. Run `!bash /content/layout-model-training/scripts/train_prima.sh`
