TITLE:
[Q] Rerun crashed/failed/deleted runs in grid search sweep

BODY:
Hi,

I'm using Pytorch Lightning as my main framework and the grid search sweep functionality to automatically distribute and run experimental combinations.

Some of the runs crash for different reason (mainly connection issues, though).

I want to delete these runs in the wandb dashboard and then rerun only the the crashed/failed experiments by restarting a new agent.

For example if 10% of my original sweep crashed/failed, what do I need to pay attention to to rerun those 10%?

Thanks in advance. :)

I'm getting a lot of 409 errors: 
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: Error 1062: Duplicate entry '690364-bnodf2og' for key 'PRIMARY'
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 409 Client Error: Conflict for url: https://api.wandb.ai/graphql
wandb: ERROR Internal wandb error: file data was not synced
Exception: The wandb backend process has shutdown

etc
