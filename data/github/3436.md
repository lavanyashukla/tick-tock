TITLE:
[App]: Tensorboard histograms don't get into wandb properly

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

I am using the `sync_tensorboard=True` feature in `wandb.init`, with a script that logs data using the tensorboard. When I log a histogram into the tensorboard, it shows up in the tensorboard tab (where an actual tensorboard instance is running) of wandb, but not in the main wandb run metrics view ("charts" view) as it should.

Here's a run you can look at to investigate this behavior: https://wandb.ai/sourceress/zack_sb3/runs/14paycf8. Note the key `train/advantages_hist` is in the tensorboard histograms view (and has histogram data) but is not in not in the wandb charts view.
