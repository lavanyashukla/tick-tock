Can't resolve Error 1062

BODY:
Details:
Ubuntu 16.04
wandb 0.10.27
python 3.6.13

I accidentally created two runs with the same run id (I know this is not normally possible). I now periodically receive the following error in my terminal:

`wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: Error 1062: DUplicate entry '232268-lxly74ya' for key 'PRIMARY' (<Response [409]>)`

I have already tried the following:
- deleting my local wandb directory (with the local run directories)
- reinstalling wandb with pip
- deleting the run from the wandb web dashboard

However, I still keep getting the error! Any help would be appreciated.
