TITLE:
[Q] Does Wandb replicate images in logs?

Hi,
I've just started to explore Wandb (*local setup*), and I want to create a table artifact with images or/and videos.
These images/videos exist in a test dataset, logged in wandb.
In the examples I read, when creating a table with images, the actual numpy arrays are logged.
These seems like a huge redundant storage consumption.
Can wandb show images in a table without actually saving a copy of them in the log?
Can I embed an image HTML tag in the table? If so, could I use a static s3 link (or use minIO on local storage)?

Thanks
