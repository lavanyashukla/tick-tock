### Describe the bug

I have a simple training loop in `fastai` which does multi-label image classification. I have a `wandb` callback attached to the `Learner` object.

However, the callback does not log any predictions from the object, it says that:
```
WandbCallback was not able to get prediction samples -> Object of type MultiCategory is not JSON serializable
