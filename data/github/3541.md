[App]: Showing multiple media (images) does not work

### Current Behavior

I am logging multiple different images per epoch, named 'img-4001', 'img-3016', etc.

By default, they are shown in different panels. I want to show them all side-by-side in one panel.

When only one image is selected as 'Media Key(s)', the image is displayed properly.

However, when I also add another image key, no image is shown at all, even the one that was properly shown before.

On a different note, I would also like to be able to select an 'epoch' slider instead of a 'step' slider on the bottom, as each image is logged exactly once per epoch.


### Expected Behavior

Both images are shown side-by-side when selecting both image keys.
