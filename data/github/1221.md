## Description
I am trying to run `wandb` behind a proxy and I was wondering how to set the proxy for `wandb`. I added the following to my `bashrc` file:
```
export http_proxy="http://my_proxy.com:port"
export https_proxy="https://my_proxy.com:port"
export HTTP_PROXY="http://my_proxy.com:port"
export HTTPS_PROXY="https://my_proxy.com:port"
```

but I still get the following error while running `wandb sync`:
```
wandb: Network error (SSLError), entering retry loop. See /home/path/to/project/wandb/debug.log for full traceback.
```

I tried entering those `export` explicitly into the command line and still got the same error.
