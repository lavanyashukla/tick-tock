TITLE:
[Q] Which is the port I should expose in my docker container to use keras Wandbcallback() to log models in wandb?

BODY:
I am currently logging my `Keras` weights in my Weights and Biases environment using `Wandbcalback()`. It works fine when I do it from my local machine.
When I do from a `container`, that is being used in the `GCP` cloud provider, the models are never being logged. I belevie I should expose some `port` in the container and in the machine to allow communication with Weights and Biases platform, but I can not find it in the documentation.
