TITLE:
[Feature]: Different symbols (now there is only the circle) for the workspace runs

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Description

It would be nice to be able to, additionally to run color, change the symbol shown in the workspace runs page.
For example, I could keep the standard "circle" symbol for the training with an CNN architecture, and use the "star" symbol for the trainings of a U-Net. This would provide a quick visual help in selecting the run I am interested in.

### Suggested Solution

Add to the menu that appears with a left-click on the run circle the option to change symbol (e.g. square, star, ...).
