TITLE:
[Q] Running wandb on ssh server but getting permission denied 

LABEL:

BODY:
I am training my models on a school cluster to which I use ssh to access. I have a conda environment where I have downloaded and logged into wandb with my API key. In my home directory on the server a .netrc file has been created with the correct API key. Furthermore, when I have activated the conda environment (called pythonenv) it is clearly indicated that I am logged into wandb with the correct account.

However, when I try to run my script using:
bash /opt/local/bin/run_job.sh --env pythonenv --script "/home/2023/davnords/test.py" 

Where inside test.py is the wandb.init with an entity that I should have access to, I get the following error:

Permission denied: '/home/2023'

I believe this is because I don't have full permissions to '/home/2023', I would be very happy if you could help me resolve this issue :)

Many thanks,
