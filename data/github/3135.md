TITLE:
Cannot access `history` or `scan_history` from `Run` object.

**Description**
I am trying to find the history connected to a particular run but run into this issue. As far as I understand, if one wants to find history, must use the `wandb.Api().run` in order to use method `history` or `scan_history`. 

But through the following code, I run into issue `TypeError: 'History' object is not callable` or `AttributeError: 'Run' object has no attribute 'scan_history'` while calling `run.history` and `run.scan_history` respectively.

```
import wandb
import uuid 

PROJ = "some-test"
ID = f"{PROJ}_{uuid.uuid4()}"
run = wandb.init(project=PROJ, id=ID)
for i in range(1000):
    wandb.log({"dummy_metric": i})
print(run.scan_history(keys=["dummy_metric"]))
```

Browsing the doc and source code, I dont not find any particular reason why my approach does not work. Therefore I want to ask here: is this behavior simply a misusage from my side or something more deliberate?
