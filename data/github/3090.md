[App]  Segmentation mask not appearing

Hi,
I'm training models on computers with no internet connection therefore I run wandb in offline mode.
I log images and their segmentation mask among with other values.
Since training is long, I want mid training to be able to see the images and their segmentation mask.
I download the log so far and use `wandb sync tmp/wandb_runs/neon_ensemble_begining_step2000_reg_max0.1_beta4.2_lr1e-05_gamma2.0/wandb/offline-run-20211229_094455-me-samuela-ensembleSelecNewFramework-1229-093531-algo-1/` to sync them.
The image itself appears on the wandb report but the segmentation masks don't.

Here is the code I use to log:
```
 wandb.log({"media/train_images_pred": wandb.Image(np.array(frame[0][:, :, None].cpu()), 
                                         masks={"predictions": {"mask_data":np.array(torch.argmax(segmentation, dim = 1)[0].cpu() * max_pred),
                                            "class_labels": pred_enum}, "ground_truth": {"mask_data": np.array(gt[0].cpu() + 2), 
                                               "class_labels": gt_enum}})})
```

Thanks
