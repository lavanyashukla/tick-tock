[CLI] Connection error, and we cannot find the requested files in the cached path

**Description**
`wandb` fails on connection attempt (sometimes before training starts, sometimes after training and logging has been working fine for a few runs).
The process errors with: 
`Run xxxxxxxx errored: ValueError('Connection error, and we cannot find the requested files in the cached path. Please try again or make sure your Internet connection is on.')`

I checked connection with curl + ping, internet on the server is up and connection to domain is working:
```
> curl -s --head  --request GET https://wandb.ai/site
HTTP/2 200
```

Tried:
- Re-login: `wandb login --relogin`
- Update 0.10.28 -> 0.10.29: issue persists

Q:
- Are their any other ways to check connection failure?
- Is there a webpage for checking wandb server/services status?



**Wandb features**
- Using sweeps with wandb.init() and wandb.log() and Huggingface integration to upload dicts of metrics and 2 Table objects.

**How to reproduce**
1. Link to a reproducible script we can run to see the bug
2. Describe what we have to do in order to trigger the issue
3. Add a zip file with the run folder

Cf. attached .zip for source script + run files.
