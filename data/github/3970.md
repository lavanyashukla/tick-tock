### Description

As a data scientist, I find myself needing to perform certain real-time queries on the results of my machine learning project runs. 
One way to achieve that is to pre-configure my training script to calculate and log the wanted values. But that requires to know the wanted queries ahead of time.
In order to run new queries on my results, I'm making use of [Azure's Data Explorer](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/). I use wandb's python client to download the data and load it into my ADX tables. This allows infinite possibilities for querying my results.
Currently, this process requires me to 
(1) load all runs and save them as a json file
(2) ingest the json file into my ADX cluster using the python SDK

This gives me a stale version of the data. So, the process needs to be repeated every time new data arrives.

### Suggested Solution

It would be extremely beneficial if wandb offered a seamless integration with ADX to allow run results to automatically sync with an ADX table.
