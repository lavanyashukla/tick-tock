wandb-cli run command not showing all runs in a project

### Description
Trying to list all projects in a run

### What I Did

```
wandb runs -p <project-name>
```
The command was successful but listed only the first 10 projects in the run. Ideally, I would expect to list all runs or have a parameter to configure how many runs I want to see.
