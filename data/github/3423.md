TITLE:
[Q] More options for custom x axis on line plots?

BODY:
I'm curious whether there will be more flexibility around plots in future versions of Wandb. Currently, the line plot only allows users to set certain logged values as the x-axis. But there are certain cases where I'd want to use a config value as the x-axis. 
For example, if I want to graph the best accuracy vs. number of layers (config value), I can't do that on the client because the client will only allow x values from those that are explicitly logged during the experiment.
