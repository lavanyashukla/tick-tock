Feature: Silent mode?

BODY:
Right now when I do "CTRL+C" it would run final eval and print accuracy. But now this gets scrolled away with several screens of logs from wandb (things like `wandb: Synced https://app.wandb.ai/yaroslavvb/transformer-xl/runs/yq4r2ru7`), it would be useful to have this go to some logfile instead
