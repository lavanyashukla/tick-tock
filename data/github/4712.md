[Feature]: Image comparison widget

### Description

Some projects like image enhancement, superresolution and shape/image generation require visually comparing output images between runs and/or between input and output. Currently the only way for me to do that on WandB is to open the images in new tabs or to download them and display in a way that I can quickly switch between them.

### Suggested Solution

We found widgets with a slider (see Alternatives) to be super useful for this kind of image comparison. It would be great to have that option on WandB directly.

### Alternatives

 [imgsli](https://imgsli.com/) is a tool we usually end up using.
