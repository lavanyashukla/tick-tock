**Description**
Hi All. Thanks for the great wandb tool. 
Currently, I am trying to log a 3d scatter plot by passing it to the `wandb.log` function and it seems not to work. I have tried passing in the `fig`, the `plt`, the `ax`. Nothing works. I am wondering what I am missing here. I guess one option is to just change to a plotly 3d plot but I do not want to do that. (I just checked and there is the exact same problem with plotly)

**Wandb features**
I am using `wandb.log`.
