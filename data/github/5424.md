[Feature]: wrap run notes

### Description

Hi, currently the notes column will hide the words that are too long (see fig). However, it's not convenient to edit. Could you enable the wrap (into multiple rows) option, so we can see the complete sentences while edting? More preferrably, also enable wrap even not in edit mode, so we can immediately see the entire notes for every run.
