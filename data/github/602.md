TITLE:
MIME encoding inconsistency for some files

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Most of text files in my Files list open in browser, but occasionally a file will trigger a download. I suspect it's something to do with how the server reports Mime type which is inconstent for some reason

IE, this file `sample-uncond-6500step.txt` triggers a download
