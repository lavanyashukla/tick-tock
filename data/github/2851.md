TITLE:
[Q] Is it possible to query for the currently active run?

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
In `script1.py`, I create a fresh training run, which saves some data to disk, and the **path depends on the W&B id**. For example, it might save to `/workspace/runs/89kkes8o`.

I'd like to get this data automatically to work with in another scripts. Rather than manually extracting the ID or the path, I'd like to query W&B for the ID of the latest/current run.

Is this possible? And, how would this behave if I'd start more than one training run; which ID would be queried then?
Otherwise, I am open for any other suggestions on how to handle this setup. Thanks!
