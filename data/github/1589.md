Warn about large summary by mistake

**Problem or Use Case**
I had a bug in my script that `wandb.log` very large array. wandb hanged at `wandb: - 0.00MB of 0.09MB uploaded (0.00MB deduped)` and timed out. (The array was larger than 0.09MB) Also the web page for the run didn't load.

**Suggested Solution**
Please warn or crash if the metric is larger than w&b can handle. Crash is better because w&b will not work normally.

**Additional context**
@vanpelt helped find out the cause.
> the run you were trying to access has over 3MB of data in the summary field.  It looks like some very large arrays of numbers were stored in that summary.  We're going to clear the summary so that the page will load.
