### Description
I was using wandb with Jupyter notebook, and it successfully connected to my account. But it failed to upload file.

wandb: Network error (TransientException), entering retry loop. See /home/wangqx/qixiong's/EO/wandb/debug.log for full traceback.
wandb: ERROR Error uploading "requirements.txt": CommError, None
wandb: ERROR Error uploading "config.yaml": CommError, None
wandb: ERROR Error uploading "___batch_archive_1.tgz": CommError, None

And the debug.log is empty.
