### Description

When wandb used in training, there are some files to be uploaded after training. It will be much better if the upload thread does not BLOCK the training process, for some reason it keeps blocking for hours which is unacceptable in hyperparameter search with sweep, I mean people using sweep without man looking after the log ! I must say in my project, it BLOCKED me for over 20 hours, and I am using cloud GPU service, that means MONEY!

### Suggested Solution

May be the upload thread can be running parallel, which can upload files while next training running.
