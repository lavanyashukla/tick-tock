TITLE:
[Q] When uploading dataset artifact, how to ignore file types?

LABEL:
c:artifacts

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I'm currently uploading my dataset using something like:
```
dataset = wandb.Artifact(..., type='dataset')
dataset.add_dir(dataset_dir)
wandb.log_artifact(dataset)
```

My dataset is around 260 GB, as there are videos with their extracted features. How would I ignore the videos, which are `.mp4` files? Is there something like `.gitignore`?

Is this related to #2799 ?
