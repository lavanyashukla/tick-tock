TITLE:
[CLI] Continuing to log on the same run without having to re-init

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Hi,
I am using the huggingface/transformers library, they have a WandbCallback integrated. I run a transformers script, using subprocess.call(), from a script which initializes wandb. The WandbCallback in the Huggingface/transformers Trainer creates it's own run instead of using the run which is already initialized(it actually logs to both but the metrics only show up in the new one).

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd like to be able to log to my existing run instead of a new run, this may be possible and I have just not found the right resource, if that is the case apologies for misclassifying the issue.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I've tried passing a run_name to the WandbCallback init step, but that just duplicates the run, so I have 2 runs with the same name.
Additionally if I avoid the init step, I receive an error that initialization is required.
