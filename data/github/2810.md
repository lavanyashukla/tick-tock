TITLE:
[Q] HP sweep (grid search) with offline logging on an HPC

BODY:
I'm a PhD student studying RL. I've really loved using wandb, and I particularly find the sweep API to be a convenient way to setup runs. I've run into a problem recently when I tried to scale up.

I'm logging a fair amount of data on many agent processes, but I'm using tensorboard and the "offline" mode on an HPC cluster. Given that I'm using grid search with no early stopping, I'm thinking that my agents should only need to communicate with wandb to get new parameter sets. I am using a lot of agents (>800), but I've introduced random jitter to their start times as well to try not to overwhelm the rate limit. Yet I still keep hiting 429 GraphQL rate limit errors.

If I'm just trying to use grid search for a bunch of agents logging offline, what would best practices be? Starting a local controller process didn't seem to help matters. The HPC in question is also SLURM (no docker support), so I'd have some difficulty setting up a wandb server instance even if I had access.
