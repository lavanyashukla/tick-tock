### Description

Export multiple images as video animation.

I noticed that the panels containing images do not have the _"Export panel"_ option.
It would be interesting to add this option in order to allow the user :
- in addition to being able to scroll and click to download an image at a given step, to download all the images in one click: when the number of steps is too high it becomes difficult to download the images one by one.
- to be able to download a sequence of images as a video animation : for example, on the screenshot below, I display the representation learned by the embedding layer of a model during the evolution of its training, and would like to see it as a video to better understand how it evolves and is organized during the training epochs. I had to manually download all the images (one after the other), and to use a software to make the video animation.

<img display="block" margin-left="auto" margin-right="auto" width="50%" alt="wandb" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49171640/173171533-ba1a41c6-b2e7-439f-844c-7b7e4734b0e6.png">


### Suggested Solution

**Allow to download all the images of a panel at the same time, and to download them as a video.**

I used [this code](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44948030/11814682) to generate a video from the images saved by wandb (`wandb/latest-run/files/media`)
