Hi,
As wandb client is using an remote server, so it seems there will be i/o concern if we logging large mounts of data like images or videos, because you need to pass images or videos through the internet. Or may be wandb only sending some kind of meta information to the remote server thus there is no such concern?

If it does have this i/o concern, does it mean that we have to use wandb/local if we need logging large mount of data like images or videos?
