TITLE:
Lost run: wandb/settings source contains parsing errors

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
`wandb --version && python --version && uname`

* Weights and Biases version: 0.8.13
* Python version: 3.7.4
* Operating System: Linux

### Description

When running multiple simultaneous jobs on a cluster it seems as though the wandb/settings file can become corrupted. In particular, I believe the cluster I was working on uses NFS storage, and different wandb processes (on different machines) were trying to read/write to the wandb/settings file at the same time.

### What I Did

1. Created a test file initializing wandb:
```
# wandb_test.py
import wandb
from random import random
from time import sleep
wandb.init(project="testing-concurrency")

wandb.config.something = 3.1459
for i in range(200):
    sleep(random())
    wandb.log({"epoch": i/10, "loss": 1/i**0.5})
```
2. Ran 100 jobs using SLURM.

### Results
99 jobs were logged into the Weights and Biases online interface. When researching why, I found this in the output logs:
```
slurm-5468220_30.out:configparser.ParsingError: Source contains parsing errors: '/path/to/file/wandb/settings'
```
