TITLE:
[Feature]: Ability to log isolated events

### Description

It would be really handy to have the ability to log instantaneous events, especially in reinforcement learning projects.
For example, `wandb.log({"Events"; "Experience Replay starts"}, step=5000)`, or `wandb.log({"Events"; "First reward"}, step=389)`.



### Suggested Solution

I am imagining a table of events:

| Event                    	| step 	|
|--------------------------	|------	|
| First reward             	| 389  	|
| Experience Replay starts 	| 5000 	|
