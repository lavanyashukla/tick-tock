### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
During my run, the API key I logged in with accidentally got deleted through the website. My run finished, but expectedly could not sync after that. After the run has finished, I have tried running 
```python
wandb sync wandb\path\to\run
```
to sync again with another API jey, but I get the following error:
```shell
Syncing: https://wandb.ai/myteam/myproject/runs/uod93v6h ...Exception in thread Thread-1:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/share/apps/python-3.9.5-shared/lib/python3.9/threading.py", line 954, in _bootstrap_inner

```

Is there a way to sync my run?
