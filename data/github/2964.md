TITLE:
[Feature] Downloading matplotlib/plotly figures using api

LABEL:
feature_request,c:api

STATE:
open

BODY:
I'd like to be able to download a figure that is logged using 
`wandb.log({"figname": fig})`
Where `fig` is a `plt.Figure` object. These figures are interactive online so i feel this is possible to implement (if it is sorry i haven't found it in the docs). 

A method in the api to download logged matplotlib/plotly figures. 

I tried this but could not find it in run.history() or anywhere. 

Thanks!
