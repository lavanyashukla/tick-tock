TITLE:
The Wandb CLI does not let you override its default location for storing credentials and other configuration details

LABEL:

BODY:
**Problem or Use Case**
The Wandb CLI does not let you use its API to override its default location for storing credentials and other configuration details (i.e. ~/.config/wandb).

**Suggested Solution**
Add a new parameter to the Wandb CLI API's login() function (or possibly init() function) that lets users of the API dictate where they would like Wandb to store their credentials and other login info (i.e. in which directory to store the 'wandb' config directory).

**Additional context**
The reason I am making this feature request is that I have not been able to use Wandb on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster because the default directory Wandb stores its credential files (i.e. ~/.config/wandb) is mandatorily read-only, that is, ~/ is read-only, and the Wandb CLI performs a call to the os.make_dir() function which is, of course, not permitted by the underlying filesystem.

Thank you in advance for your time!
