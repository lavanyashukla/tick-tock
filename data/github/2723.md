TITLE:
[Feature] Is it possible to log additional values once a run is finished?

BODY:
I would like to log a new evaluation metric for all steps of a finished run (based on the checkpoints that I can reload and use to compute the new metric). Is it possible?
I've been through the doc and didn't find a way to do it. I can either modify the summary of a finished run with the `wandb.apis.public.Run` API, or log data on new runs with the `wandb.wandb_run.Run` API.

**Edit:**
Using the `wandb.wandb_run.Run` API, I was able to resume a previous run by specifying `entity`, `project` and `id`. However, the API `log` function doesn't allow non strictly incremental `step` argument.

The workaround mentioned [here](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1626#issuecomment-878722263) require to 
- have anticipated this by logging a dedicated `step` value like `epoch` (which fortunately I did)
- update all visualization that use the `step` value to use the `epoch` value instead (which will take me some times :-/)

Would it be possible to enable non-incremental step logging ? I know it can be dangerous (loosing data), but it would be pretty convenient.
