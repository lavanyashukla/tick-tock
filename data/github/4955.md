[Q] Logged table only shows up in artifacts not on run page

Hi, 

Maybe I have missed something, but after I log the predictions and the true labels of my model they only show up in the artifacts and not on the run page.

Furthermore, I tried adding manually a data table on the run page, but it seems to be disabled.

Most probably I am missing something, here's the code I am using (obviously after `wandb.init` has been called

```
batch_id = torch.arange(batch_size)[:, None].tolist()
                # TRAIN: make a table with the true labels, predicted labels and confidence
                train_pred_confidence, train_pred_label = torch.max(train_pred, dim=1)
                table = self.wandb.Table(data=batch_id, columns=["batch_id"])
                table.add_column("true_label", train_y.tolist())
                table.add_column("predicted_label", train_pred_label.tolist())
                table.add_column("confidence", train_pred_confidence.tolist())
                self.wandb.log({"train_predictions": table}, step=strategy.training_counter)
```
