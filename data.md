Ticket #1
Subject: Artifact Download Error
Category: Artifacts
Description: I've been trying to download an artifact from my latest experiment, specifically a model file, but keep getting an "Access Denied" error despite being logged in and the owner of the project. The artifact is crucial for my next set of experiments. Is there a permission setting I'm missing, or could this be a bug?
Ticket #2
Subject: Reports Not Generating
Category: Reports
Description: After creating a new report and adding all necessary insights, visualizations, and markdown annotations, I'm unable to generate a shareable link. The process seems to start but then fails silently without any error message. This report is needed for our weekly team review. Can you provide assistance on how to resolve this issue?
Ticket #3
Subject: Workspace Loading Forever
Category: Workspaces
Description: Whenever I try to access my workspace, the loading screen persists indefinitely without displaying any of my projects or experiments. This started happening yesterday, and I've tried clearing my browser's cache and using a different device with no success. Is there an ongoing issue with Weights & Biases workspaces?
Ticket #4
Subject: Sweep Configuration Error
Category: Sweeps
Description: I'm encountering an issue where my sweep configuration doesn't seem to be recognized by the wandb client. The YAML file has been validated, but when initiating the sweep, I get a syntax error. Could you provide guidance on common configuration mistakes or check if there's an issue with my account's sweep functionality?
Ticket #5
Subject: Prompt Creation Failed
Category: Prompts
Description: Attempting to create custom prompts for logging specific metrics and visualizations, but the creation process fails with a generic "Failed to create prompt" message. I've followed the documentation closely, but can't seem to find what's going wrong. Any advice on how to troubleshoot this?
Ticket #6
Subject: Launch Job Stuck in Queue
Category: Launch
Description: I've submitted a job using Weights & Biases Launch, but it's been stuck in the queue for several hours without starting. There's no indication of what might be causing the delay or how to prioritize the job. Is there a way to diagnose the hold-up or expedite the job's start?
Ticket #7
Subject: Table Visual Not Updating
Category: Tables
Description: I've set up a table in Weights & Biases to dynamically display experiment results. However, the table isn't updating in real-time as expected, and in some cases, it shows outdated information even after refreshing the page. Is there a known issue with table updates, or do I need to adjust my setup?
Ticket #8
Subject: Slow Dashboard Performance
Category: Performance
Description: Recently, I've noticed significantly slower performance in the Weights & Biases dashboard, especially when loading large experiments or accessing historical data. This slowdown is impacting my workflow. Are there any recommended practices to improve dashboard performance, or is this a server-side issue?
Ticket #9
Subject: Deployment Issues with Model
Category: Deployment
Description: I'm trying to deploy a model trained and logged with Weights & Biases, but I'm encountering errors during the deployment process related to compatibility and dependencies. The documentation on deployment is somewhat unclear for my specific use case. Can you provide detailed steps or support for deploying models to production environments?
Ticket #10
Subject: Artifact Version Conflicts
Category: Artifacts
Description: I'm experiencing version conflicts with artifacts in my project. When trying to update an artifact with a new version, the system doesn't seem to recognize it as a new version and instead throws an error about duplicate entries. What's the proper way to handle versioning for artifacts?
Ticket #11
Subject: Custom Report Sharing Issue
Category: Reports
Description: I created a custom report with detailed analysis and visuals but am unable to share it with non-project members. The shareable link prompts for a login, and external collaborators do not have access to our W&B account. Is there a way to share reports publicly or with specific access controls?
Ticket #12
Subject: Unable to Clone Workspace
Category: Workspaces
Description: I've been trying to clone a workspace for a new member of our team, but the clone operation fails every time with a vague error message. This workspace setup is crucial for standardizing our project environments. Could you provide some insight or assistance on cloning workspaces successfully?
Ticket #13
Subject: Hyperparameter Sweep Stalling
Category: Sweeps
Description: My hyperparameter sweep gets initiated but stalls after a few iterations without any errors or logs indicating a problem. It's as if the sweep pauses indefinitely. I've checked my code and the sweep configuration for any obvious issues but found none. What might be causing this behavior?
Ticket #14
Subject: Prompt Deletion Error
Category: Prompts
Description: I'm trying to delete some outdated custom prompts from our project, but each attempt results in a failure with an "Internal Server Error" message. These prompts are no longer needed and clutter our workspace. How can I successfully remove them?
Ticket #15
Subject: Launch Configuration Not Saving
Category: Launch
Description: Whenever I configure and save a new launch setup for my experiments, the configuration seems to revert to default settings upon revisiting the launch page. This forces me to reconfigure launches each time, wasting valuable time. Is there a save issue or am I missing a step?
Ticket #16
Subject: Table Permissions for Collaborative Editing
Category: Tables
Description: I've set up a table for collaborative data analysis with my team, but others are unable to edit or add entries. The permission settings aren't clear on how to enable editing for specific users or groups. Can you guide me on setting up collaborative permissions for tables?
Ticket #17
Subject: Dashboard Customization Limits
Category: Performance
Description: I'm hitting a limit on how much I can customize my dashboard, especially with embedding external data sources and complex visualization widgets. The performance also degrades with more customizations. Are there recommended practices for maintaining dashboard performance while maximizing customization?
Ticket #18
Subject: Model Deployment Failure Due to Size
Category: Deployment
Description: Attempting to deploy a large-scale model trained and managed with W&B, but the deployment process fails, citing size limitations. The model is crucial for our application, and I need guidance on deploying large models efficiently with your platform.
Ticket #19
Subject: Inconsistent Artifact Download Speeds
Category: Artifacts
Description: Download speeds for artifacts from my experiments vary significantly, with some downloads taking an unusually long time compared to others of similar size. This inconsistency is affecting my workflow. Are there known issues or optimizations for artifact retrieval?
Ticket #20
Subject: Report Visualization Compatibility
Category: Reports
Description: Some of the visualizations in my reports are not displaying correctly when viewed on different devices or browsers, particularly complex graphs and interactive elements. Is there a compatibility guide or best practices for ensuring visualizations are consistently rendered across platforms?
