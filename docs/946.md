### Description
Hi it comes to my attention that Weights and Bias crushes or is extremely slow when I try to open a experiments table UI with Chrome (the version specified above) but open in a reasonable time with Safari.    

Are there any known incompatibility to Chrome or its plug-ins?

Let me know if you need more information from me to reproduce this issue.

Thank you very much in advance.
