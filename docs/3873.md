[Feature]: Custom LineSeries

### Description

Hi, 

I have multiple runs which share the config value 'length' (basically a hyperparameter) with different values (in my case 16, 32, 128, 256).

I would now like to plot the values of 'NN' and 'iFFT' on the y-axis with 'length' providing the x-axis.

Unfortunately, wandb only let's me pick a single value to plot as shown in the field 'lineVal', but I want two or more values to be plotted.

I am aware that one could log line_series, but I would like to create such a multi-line plot a posteriori.

How could I plot different logged values in a single plot with a shared x-axis which is provided from the config?

### Suggested Solution

I'd like to pick an arbitrary number of line series after running experiments and plot them jointly.
