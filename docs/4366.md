### Current Behavior

Hello! I enjoy using your W&B project in my DNN training, but recently I found my W&B get stuck occasionally at the final stage (all the epoches run are finished), showing the following log:
```log
wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish... (success).
```
maybe around 2 hours later, here comes the following logs:
```log
wandb: ERROR Dropped streaming file chunk (see wandb/debug-internal.log) // 4 continuous lines of that
...
wandb: Run History: // the following are normal History and summary then synced W&B files.
```
As I check the `wandb/debug-internal.log`, in the meanwhile it stuck, the logs:
```log

```
after 2 hours of logging like that, it finally get `handle_request: poll_exit` and `send_request: poll_exit`, then `scan save`. All as usual.

I met this case for several times, for using `wandb.ai` and my private host (at the first stage I thought my poor Internet connection caused it but now it seemed not).

### Expected Behavior

The expected behavior is simple: the Wandb can normally finish its work and start another run rather than  blocked for such a long time, which is really annoying when I want to run a batch of script of different hyparameters or in a Wandb sweep.
