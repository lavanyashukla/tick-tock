[Q] Recording multiple models/runs in single script

Hello WandB community. Is there a way to record multiple runs in a single script? Looked around for answers but could not find any. I would like to do something like:

```Python
wb1 = wandb.init(project="asdf", config={"model": 'model1'})
wb2 = wandb.init(project="asdf", config={"model": 'model2'})

for i in range(iters):
  # Expand training dataset:
  x, y = expand(x, y)
  # Reload best existing model and train for a few epochs:
  model1.fit(x, y, ... , callbacks=[WandbCallback(wb1)])
  model2.fit(x, y, ... , callbacks=[WandbCallback(wb2)])

wandb.finish()
```


Some possibilities that might work?
- Use a combination of wandb resumes.
- Manually log e.g. `wandb.log({"acc":acc, "loss":loss})`
- Groups? https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/grouping
