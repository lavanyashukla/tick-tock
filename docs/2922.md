BODY:
I tried to make table with examples of output of my classification network, with two columns: image and probabilities distribution over classes. I want to show distribution like an interactive bar chart for the better view.  
I tried to use this tutorial about custom bar charts: https://wandb.ai/wandb/plots/reports/Custom-Bar-Charts--VmlldzoyNzExNzk

That's working fine as usual plot, but when I trying to put object of the plot into table I got error message, that CustomBarChart is not JSON serialisable object.

My question is: how i can make table with bar chart plot?
