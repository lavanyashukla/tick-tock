TITLE:
[Feature]: Reduce `wandb` folder size by continuously deleting files that have already been synced

### Description

Hi team - I'm running into storage space issues on my VM after a while of W&B training. After a few hours my `wandb` local folder is several GB large and eventually leads to the disk filling up and the training run crashing. This happens in particular when logging image snapshots or other storage-intensive assets.

I see that there is a command `wandb sync --clean`. But I'm not sure whether this would possibly delete unsynced data points? Else I guess it could be used in another process with `watch -n 60 "yes | wandb sync --clean"` or similar?

### Suggested Solution

It would be nice if this was already integrated in W&B. At some point, storage will fill up on any machine, which can be a major headache.

### Alternatives

I guess an alternative would be to use something like suggested above?
