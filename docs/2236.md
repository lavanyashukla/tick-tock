**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
We are working a lot with preemptive instances, so we need a way to checkpoint and resume runs from checkpoints.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Thank you for implementing resumable sweep runs: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/resuming#preemptible-sweeps
Eventually we want this: ```As of version 0.10.31, requeued preempted runs begin execution from their initial step, rather than starting from the training iteration that they were at when they were preempted. Automated checkpointing for preempted runs is an area of future development.```

The first step to support this would be: https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/2234
And another parallel step would be this feature I am describing here.

When the algorithm is started from preempted state it should get a notification about this, ideally including the step count. This should be added as a command line argument to the train argument call.
