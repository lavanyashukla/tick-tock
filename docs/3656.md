### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python 
import wandb
wandb.init(...)

wandb.log({"/test_image": wandb.Image(...)})
```

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
Permission Error: [Errno 13] Permission Denied: '/test_image_0_1823490.png'
```

The issue here is the joining of the key together with the path in `wandb/sdk/data_types/base_types/media.py`.
Joining with a leading slash leads to the file having a root directory as destination, which will be blocked on most devices.

A decent solution could be cleaning the key to not have leading slashes or throwing an error that makes this easier to debug.
