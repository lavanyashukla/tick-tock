[App]: Crashed state requires to call `wandb sync` for every metrics update

### Current Behavior

Hi Everyone,

Using `pytorch-lightning` for training with `wandb` to visualize the training/validation metrics, I sometimes get disconnected due to networking issues, so I get the following message once in a while:

```shell
wandb: WARNING A graphql request initiated by the public wandb API timed out (timeout=9 sec). Create a new API with an integer timeout larger than 9, e.g., `api = wandb.Api(timeout=19)` to increase the graphql timeout.
```

In one of the experiments that had these warnings, the `State` on wandb showed `crashed` while the experiment is still running. `wandb sync` works, however the problem is the metrics will not update without `wandb sync`. 

In addition, the `State` would change from `crashed` to `finished`, while its still running.

### Expected Behavior

I would expect calling `wandb sync` to sync once and for all, rather than having to call it every time to be synced.
