[Q] How to use wandb to visualise GPU utilisation?

Hi,

I am experiencing the same problem as mentioned in an unresolved but closed issue (https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/1373) i.e. no GPU-related plot in the system tab. 

While running the colab from https://wandb.ai/authors/ayusht/reports/Using-GPUs-With-Keras-A-Tutorial-With-Code--VmlldzoxNjEyNjE I am not able to visualise GPU utilisation. I am simply using `WandbCallback` in the `model.fit` function.

I verified and the GPU is detected in the Overview tab. I tried adding a new panel but there are no GPU-related options to visualise on the Y-axis. I would appreciate an answer since I spent a lot of time searching for related documentation without success. 

Thank you!
