TITLE:
[CLI] Wandb does not log wandb.Histogram

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
I am trying to log a histogram and even the simplest examples do not work. However, logging scalars work. 

**Wandb features + How to reproduce**

` 
wandb.log({"histogram": wandb.Histogram([1,2,3])})
`
The above line does not log anything and does not give any errors. If I submit a np_histogram, it also fails. Logging integers work. 

**Environment**
- OS: Mac OS Catalina 10.15.5
- Environment: venv
- Python Version: 3.9
- wandb version: 0.10.31
