### Description

Creating workspace layouts via UI is rather tedious for projects which log a large number of metrics.   You have to search and pick them one-by-one, switch to different tabs to edit titles, etc.  
I would prefer to create layouts as a JSON documents, similarly to configuring Tensorboard's "custom scalars" view.

JSON export would also allow to backup layouts and to transfer them between projects.

### Suggested Solution

Implement workspace export/import to/from JSON

### Alternatives

Make layout editing UI less tedious?
