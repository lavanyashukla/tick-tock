## Overview
Currently, the `wandb` client saves an excellent collection of data for the purpose of reproducibility such as `requirements.txt`, the git repo and state, and the command that was used to run the experiments. However, it still would take leg work to reproduce the experiments: the user would need to manually clone the repo, checkout the branch, setup venv, run the experiments.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great to have auto generated commands to reproduce the run: something the users could just copy and past to the terminal and reproduce the experiment. For example, consider [this run](https://wandb.ai/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/runs/1kpt8dsa/overview?workspace=user-costa-huang), using the data in the repo it is possible to auto generate code to reproduce this specific experiments, such as the following:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r https://api.wandb.ai/files/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/1kpt8dsa/requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl
git checkout -b "BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4__ppo_atari_visual__2__1591793872" a6d0a625ac7175e01b0562d281ea3429e69aae69
/opt/conda/bin/python ppo_atari_visual.py --gym-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 --total-timesteps 10000000 --wandb-project-name cleanrl.benchmark --wandb-entity cleanrl --prod-mode --capture-video --seed 2

```

If the code-saving is enabled, it should also be possible to reproduce with 
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r https://api.wandb.ai/files/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/1kpt8dsa/requirements.txt
curl -OL https://api.wandb.ai/files/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/1kpt8dsa/code/cleanrl/ppo_atari_visual.py
python ppo_atari_visual.py --gym-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 --total-timesteps 10000000 --wandb-project-name cleanrl.benchmark --wandb-entity cleanrl --prod-mode --capture-video --seed 2
```

The code samples above should work for linux and mac, for windows a different set of commands might be required. And maybe put those code here:

## Subtleness to this issue:

There are some subtleness to this issue. Here are something I can think of. 

1. Sometimes people use conda to manage the experiments, which means the `requirements.txt` is going to have things like `conda-build==3.18.11` that is not really installable through PyPi. This means directly installing the `requirements.txt` will fail. The correct way to handle this I think is to record the conda env yaml file if conda is present and install the conda env prior to the installing the `requirements.txt`. Like

```
curl -OL https://api.wandb.ai/files/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/1kpt8dsa/conda_environment.yml # the client needs to auto save conda_environment.yml to make it work
conda env update --name venv --file conda_environment.yml
conda activate venv
pip install -r https://api.wandb.ai/files/cleanrl/cleanrl.benchmark/1kpt8dsa/requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl
git checkout -b "BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4__ppo_atari_visual__2__1591793872" a6d0a625ac7175e01b0562d281ea3429e69aae69
/opt/conda/bin/python ppo_atari_visual.py --gym-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 --total-timesteps 10000000 --wandb-project-name cleanrl.benchmark --wandb-entity cleanrl --prod-mode --capture-video --seed 2
```


2. Some packages are installed in *editable* mode (i.e. a local installation of the package that is not available in PyPi), this will also cause the `requirements.txt` installation to crash. One solution I can think of is to just warn the user if *editable* packages are detected.
