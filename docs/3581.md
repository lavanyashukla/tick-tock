TITLE:
[Feature]: ROC/PR Curve for multi label classification

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Description

Currently existing plot libraries are only applicable to single label classification.
It will be helpful to extend it to multi labels (e.g. multi-label image classification, audio tagging etc).

### Suggested Solution

We need to change `roc_curve` and `pr_curve` functions.

current interface of roc_curve:

```
def pr_curve(y_true=None, y_probas=None, labels=None, classes_to_plot=None, title=None):
```

suggested interface of roc_curve:

```
def pr_curve(y_true=None, y_probas=None, labels=None, classes_to_plot=None, title=None, multi_label=False):
```

if `multi_label` is set to be `True`, then `y_true` should be a 2-d array of binary value (e.g. [[1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], ...).

### Alternatives

I am considering to work around this issue by implementing a custom plot function in my project.

### Additional Context

I don't exactly know the effects of this change, but other part which only assume single label should be changed due to this change.
