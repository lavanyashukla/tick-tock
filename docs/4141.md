TITLE:
[CLI]: Cannot access artifact via public API any more

### Describe the bug

The public API throws an error when trying to access an artifact. The artifact exists for sure and this download has worked before. The artifact in question is even already downloaded in the artifacts folder. This artifact is a reference artifact and is actually stored on GCP.  
```python
     api = wandb.Api(timeout=30)
    artifact = api.artifact("cradle-bio/datasets/common_study_dataset:latest")
    artifact_dir = artifact.checkout()
```
Throws error:
