Question - Plotting 3D graphs (scatter plot/lines)

LABEL:

BODY:
I am trying to log 3D plots using scatter plot and line, to get something like in the image below. I have looked at the 3D object type which already exists that take snl, obj and other format data which requires vertices faces and lot more than what 3D lines have. 
I was able to plot just the points by passing [x y z]'s but I mainly want to plot the lines. 

It would be great if I can get some pointers on how to get this to work in Wandb. 
Thanks in advance!
