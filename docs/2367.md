TITLE:
[Q] Early Stopping - Unclear documentation. What is an iteration?

BODY:
When using wandb.sweep to do early stopping, what *exactly* do min_iter / max_iter specify? The documentation is very unclear, and from looking at the code and testing with various settings I still can't determine what exactly an 'iter' is.

The docs say it's based on 'logging' iterations for the metric - so if i have a metric that I log say,  only every 100 model steps, but when calling wandb.log I accurately report the model step count, like so:

```
wandb.log(loss, step=100)
```

and then 100 steps later

```
wandb.log(loss, step=200)
```

is the number of iterations here (as hyperband sees it) - 2, or 200?
