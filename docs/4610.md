### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
Hi,
I'm training a yolov5 model in colab using weights and biases for the checkpoint feature. However, sometimes I'm getting the error pasted below. This can happen at the start of the training or in middle of the training. Last time my training got killed after 130 epochs due to this error.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```
!python train.py --img 1280 --rect --batch -1 --epochs 200 --data /content/drive-mnt/dataset --weights yolov5s.pt --save-period 5 --upload_dataset --cache
```


<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
      0/199      7.41G     0.1254      0.101    0.03192         33       1280:   0% 0/106 [00:02<?, ?it/s]wandb: ERROR Failed to sample metric: psutil.NoSuchProcess process no longer exists (pid=564)

```



A second issue I notice is that for some reason I cannot use --resume with yolov5 and w&b path anymore
```
!python train.py --resume wandb-artifact://redacted/YOLOv5/3laxf9ci
```
gives me
```
AssertionError: File not found: wandb-artifact://redacted/YOLOv5/3laxf9ci
```
I double checked and the path does exist in my w&b account.
Furthermore, for both issues I'm logged in correctly.
The wandb version I'm using is `wandb==0.13.6`
Any idea what might be causing this?
