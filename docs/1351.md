Hi, there

  I found that the legend for plotting does not work for user's attributes, and only works for pre-defined attributes like name, id, datecreated. Here is the screenshot of the issue, where I try to use the attribute 'args.dropout' as the legend, but it didn't show up.

  I'm wondering if it's a bug or it's not supported yet. Thanks!
