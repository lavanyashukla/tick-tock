[CLI]: sweep agent creates multiple runs with same ID

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

Hi,

I am running a sweep of offline runs on our cluster. I run them offline to avoid spamming wandb with requests, and sync the runs after they are all finished.
However, I noticed that mutliple runs receive the same ID, which means that they are merged together as one run on the web app. Locally they are separate runs.

In this particular case, I ran 10 separate jobs (we use slurm) that started at the same time, each job boiling down to this:
```bash
export WANDB_MODE="offline"
wandb agent ENTITY/PROJECT/SWEEPID --count 10
```

Here is a screenshot of my `wandb` folder with the local runs:

And here is a snippet of the IDs and their number of occurences:
```
001prev3: 1, 0s85ue7s: 1, 1plunaw2: 1, 1vk0sr0l: 2, 2409qdrm: 2, 2bh30mru: 1, 2zdhl5a9: 2, 3mwumpkt: 2, 4m2gvcl9: 2, 
5vacmjhf: 2, 762lidf2: 2, 8misfpfq: 1, 902z4bds: 2, 9e7pq9bq: 2, 9oyuxjsj: 2, dka9f1k6: 1, dsci61yx: 2, du7i2jev: 1, 
ftb7ue04: 1, g1g94gqo: 1, gx22sxbk: 1, h1ldk4g1: 2, h7ox4tms: 2, hel4ple6: 2, hjmi0uq5: 2, iff9wsen: 2, ijrg220m: 2, 
ikvkx0jt: 1, ixbumq10: 2, jr5q249f: 1, kmu2gux3: 2, l4vngfh0: 1, memcj53z: 2, mmdfl63w: 1, n9qm7bm1: 2, nlknyhbc: 1, 
os3d3w1b: 1, p8paibc6: 1, ptsri2gn: 1, q0kiott9: 1, q5tblbe6: 2, rycxhx9u: 2, s9z2k1z7: 2, sbus46tn: 2, sesr1lzq: 2, 
soec4t2k: 2, sx12rizt: 1, t01rozqi: 1, t04kps2e: 1, t0t5uwwj: 2, u4ru7yxs: 2, v6ykra00: 2, vntbjher: 2, vtjpnagi: 1, 
wfusu9fe: 2, wrrm9oxp: 2, xcz7y9uf: 2, xew668nb: 2, y95cpnin: 2, zgfs0mo0: 1, zy31f8t1: 1
```

As an example, here is a visualization of logged data from a 2-occurence run (purple) vs 1-occurence run (cyan). I believe the purple run has 2 datapoints per timestep, and tries to connect them together:

I think this is specific to sweeps, since when I make independent runs (1 slurm-job per run), everything works perfectly.
Also, many of these runs are considered as `crashed` in the web app until I synchronise them, and they get their statuses updated to `finished`.

Any ideas how I can fix this? These sweeps are a very cool feature, I would love to be able to use them properly! I think it might be related to #3682, but no solution was posted.
