TITLE:
Avoid returning None on init

LABEL:
feature_request,c:core

STATE:
open

BODY:
It's a bit inconvenient that that init may return `None`, especially since I have to manually check before using `with` when using mypy. Looks like the following TODO is an intended fix for that, considering how easy of a fix it'd be I'd love to see it happen.
