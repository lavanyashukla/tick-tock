**Describe the bug**
The names of the columns in the table view are wrongly displayed.
The charts are correctly named though.

Here are a couple of screenshots:

You can see that the table view parses the column names wrongly by creating additional columns for "train/u_min" and "Min U"  instead of leaving it at "MinU" which is correctly shown in the chart view.

Additionally, "Train_Epoch/LL" should actually be "Train/EpochLL" so it's substituting characters for some reason.
It should be noted that the correct columns are shown.
