### Description

Just trying to declare some hyperparameters in Jupyter Lab

### What I Did

```
wandb.init()
config = wandb.config
```

```
config.learning_rate = 0.1
config.mini_batch_size = 32
config.anneal_factor = 0.5
config.patience = 5
config.max_epochs = 1000
```

While executing that 2nd cell, Jupyter Lab just hangs indefinitely.  Curiously when I stop the kernel and run `config`, it returns  a list of the odict keys that I assigned (learning_rate, mini_batch_size, etc).  Jupyter keeps showing the asterisk, indicating that it's working, indefinitely.
