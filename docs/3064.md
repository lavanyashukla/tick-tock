TITLE:
Configure wandb to shut down immediately at Ctrl+C signal

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
During debugging loops, I often have to interrupt my program with Ctrl+C.

After it terminates, wandb still will spend time uploading useless data to the the cloud. It'd be nice to have a wandb option/mode that ensures immediate and super-fast quit at Ctrl+C request.

Currently I often have to "rage quit" wandb synchronization by spamming more Ctrl+C keystrokes and these lead to all sort of strange exceptions

It is supposed to do  "Control-C detected -- Run data was not synced", but it isn't happening reliably, it depends on the moment Ctrl+C is hit
