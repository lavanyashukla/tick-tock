Hello everyone! 
I used to log tiny(10x10 pixels or so) images into runs and they just enlarged in wandb, so I could see everything fine. However, recently, images and gifs have started to appear smoothed and I don't see how to switch it off. As a solution, I can load pictures of normal size, but, I think, I can save a lot of space by logging small images. 

Example of smoothed image:
