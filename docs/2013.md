**Describe the bug**
When exploring data in a parallel coordinates plot and pointing the cursor to a line at the bottom of the plot. The legend will be displayed below the line such that it is outside the visible area of the plot

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a sweep 
2. Add two runs
3. Point cursor at a line the is next to the bottom of the plot
4. See that it is not visible or partly visible

**Expected behavior**
I would expect to see the legend above the line. This is the behaviour for other plots.
