[Q] events and code files not uploaded

Hi, I'm new to wandb and is running code in [ppo-implementation-details](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/ppo-implementation-details) following the video tutorial [Part 1 of 3 â€” Proximal Policy Optimization Implementation: 11 Core Implementation Details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEt6rrxH8W4).

The related code in the `ppo.py` are shown as follows
```python
    if args.track:
        import wandb
        wandb.init(
            project=args.wandb_project_name,
            entity=args.wandb_entity,
            sync_tensorboard=True,
            config=vars(args),
            name=run_name,
            monitor_gym=True,
            save_code=True,
        )
```

I ran `python ppo.py --track --capture-video` and saw the media uploaded, but found no events and code files on the wandb website console so that there is not any loss plot online.

Specifically, I got the logs
```
wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish... (success).
wandb:
wandb: Synced CartPole-v1__ppo__1__1662611168: https://wandb.ai/carlos-shi/ppo-implementation-details/runs/y7wbggib
wandb: Synced 6 W&B file(s), 4 media file(s), 0 artifact file(s) and 0 other file(s)
wandb: Find logs at: .\wandb\run-20220908_122611-y7wbggib\logs
```

But in the tutorial video, the expected log after running the same code is  like `wandb: Synced 6 W&B file(s), 4 media file(s), 0 artifact file(s) and 2 other file(s)`, which seems to me that the event and code files are not uploaded.

I also ran `tensorboard --logdir .\runs\CartPole-v1__ppo__1__1662608133\` and checked the logs were written correctly.

I'm on PyCharm Windows 10, with Python 3.8.13 and wandb 0.13.2. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
