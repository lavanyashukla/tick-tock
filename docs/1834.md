TITLE:
[Feature] Workspace: Specify sections for charts from wandb.log()

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Every logs metrics is plotted in the "Charts" section of WandB.
If you have a lot of metrics of different types it can soon be messy.

For example, in one of my projects, I have more than 5 timers. 
It is super convenient to add them into the same section.
This needs to be done manually for the moment. A way to do it programmatically would be nice.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
 I would like to have an extra parameter in the wandb.log function to log the data in a different section than the default "Graphs" one.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Or maybe if a dictionary of dictionaries is passed to WandB logs, it can be plotted into the section named by the key of the master dictionary. This solution would suit me best, but I don't know for the general use case.

**Additional context**
Here an example of data plot into different sections:
