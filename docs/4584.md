TITLE:
[CLI]: Possibly broken type hint for wandb.run

LABEL:

BODY:
### Describe the bug

My IDE (Visual Studio Code) is unable to infer the type of `wandb.run`, giving it as `Unknown | None`. 

Line 124 of wandb's `__init__.py` is as follows:

```python
run: Optional["wandb.sdk.wandb_run.Run"] = None
```

Elsewhere in the file, `wandb.sdk` is referred to using the variable `wandb_sdk`, which is set on line 26 of `__init__.py`. Modifying line 124 as follows fixes the type hinting for me:

```python
run: Optional["wandb_sdk.wandb_run.Run"] = None
```

I'm not sure if this is a genuine issue with the type hint on line 124, or if VSCode (or Pylance?) should be able to handle this anyway.
