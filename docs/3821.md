### Description

Hi, 

I don't find nothing clear about logging new tables (or logging whatever in general) to an existing and finished run. I would like to be able to run my trianing in a remote machine and then in my local machine log new tables to the run created in the remote machine which is supposed to be finished.   

### Suggested Solution

I want to be able to compute metrics (for example) and log them in a table to an existing and finished run. I don't know how to implement this in low-level because I am just a user.

### Alternatives

Be able to create subproject and link runs between subprojects. For example, given project "foo" I would spawn two subprojects one for training results and one for test/val/whatever results: "foo-train", "foo-test". Then, link runs between these two subprojects in order to visualize them in a single panel.
