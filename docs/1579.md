TITLE:
Wandb only terminates one process when using DDP.

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Describe the bug**

Each time I run a sweep (one or multiple runs per agent), some processes are left running (these hog 100% the processor they're assigned to and eat up RAM). The data from GPUs is not cleared after finishing a sweep, leading to  `CUDA out of memory` error.  Afterwards I need to kill all processes individually. After stopping the sweep I get this error.

`/home/jpohjone/miniconda3/envs/models/lib/python3.8/multiprocessing/resource_tracker.py:216: UserWarning: resource_tracker: There appear to be 6 leaked semaphore objects to clean up at shutdown`

There is no problem when running a normal run (ie. copying and running the same command that the sweep uses).

**To Reproduce**

I can create  a small example script later I if seems the bug can't be solved otherwise.

**Expected behavior**

Shut down the script correctly after sweep is done.

**Screenshots**

Snippet from `htop`.

**Operating system and other versions**
 - OS: Ubuntu 20.04.1 LT
 - wand: 10.12
 - python: 3.8.5
 - torch: 1.7.0
 - miniconda3


**Additional context**

I use four GPUs with DDP to distribute jobs, but the problem persists even when I only use 1 GPU.
