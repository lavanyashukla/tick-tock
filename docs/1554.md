TITLE:
Custom Charts: Parameterize number of samples in pr_curve

LABEL:

**Requested feature**
Currently the number of points to plot when using `wandb.plot.pr_curve` is hardcoded to 20:

https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/488f6db75b36b2d44a0cb5a770040408487d05aa/wandb/plot/pr_curve.py#L70-L81

This is a bit frustrating because it leads to a very bad curve in some cases:

There is no point between ~ 0.8 and ~ 0.98 here. The problem is solved by just setting `samples` to a higher number, e. g. 100.

**Suggested Solution**
This would be solved by simply making `samples` an argument to `pr_curve` and setting it to 20 by default.

If you are willing to change this I could open a PR with the change - would be only a couple of lines.
