**Problem or Use Case**
I frequently use `wandb.watch` to observe my model's gradients throughout the training process to make sure training is properly taking place. I thought that it would be convenient if there was a filter function for us to be able to choose which gradients we want to view, considering that there are typically hundreds or thousands of these histogram plots. For example, it would be convenient to be able to select to show only the weights/biases or only the gradients at certain parts of the model.

**Suggested Solution**
A dropdown menu with checkboxes for each component is one idea that I had. For example, if I had a model that looked like the following:

```Python
>>> import torch.nn as nn
>>> class Model(nn.Module):
...     def __init__(self):
...         super(Model, self).__init__()
...         self.linear = nn.Linear(in_features=3, out_features=3)
...         self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
...     def forward(self, x):
...         linear_output = self.linear(x)
...         return self.softmax(linear_output)
>>> model = Model()
>>> print(model)
Model (
    (linear): Linear(in_features=3, out_features=3, bias=True)
    (softmax): Softmax(dim=-1)
)
```

then maybe there could be something like

- [ ] All
- [ ] Model
  - [ ] linear
  - [ ] softmax


**Alternatives**
Alternatives would be to just sort according to `weight` or `bias`, since that in and of itself would also be convenient.
