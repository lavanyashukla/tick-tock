### Description

I was trying to run multiple sweeps in parallel using a local controller. The documentation isn't very clear, so I thought it was supported, with the only caveat that the controller would only schedule a new run once the scheduled queue was empty.

Based on the comments from `wandb_controller` I was surprised that only one of my workers were running and all others were idle. Maybe the definition of "scheduled" leaves room for confusion?

```
    Protocols:
        Scheduling a run:
        - client controller adds a schedule entry on the controller.schedule list
        - cloud backend notices the new entry and creates a run with the parameters
        - cloud backend adds a scheduled entry on the scheduler.scheduled list
        - client controller notices that the run has been scheduled and removes it from
          controller.schedule list
    Current implementation details:
        - Runs are only schedule if there are no other runs scheduled.
```

### What I Did
I defined the parameters for my local sweep in a YAML file:
```
program: run.py
method: bayes
metric:
  name: mape
  goal: minimize
controller:
  type: local
parameters:
  days:
    min: 1
    max: 7
  smoothing:
    min: 0.0
    max: 0.995

```
and ran from the command line:
```
$ wandb sweep --controller --verbose sweep.yaml
```

PS: The problem goes away when you run the cloud version of the sweep. I understand this may not be an urgent feature, but it would be great to at least make it clear that local sweeps do not support parallel agents for now.
