[CLI]: creating sweep triggers repeated/infinite initiations

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

When initiating a sweep from the command line with `wandb sweep` on a busy server, I frequently get the command hanging with output

```
wandb: Creating sweep from: path/to/sweep.yaml
wandb: Network error (ReadTimeout), entering retry loop.
```

However, in the web interface, I can see that wandb is *repeatedly* creating instances of the same sweep. I am positive there is no other command being executed to create this sweep in any other process.

To reproduce, on the command line, I simply run `wandb sweep path/to/sweep.yaml`. As I observed above, this is on a server running a handful of other sweeps at the same time (up to a dozen, none of which are logging more than every ~3mins). This does not always happen, but happens around 20% of the time when launching sweeps, which is enough to be very annoying.

The full traceback, as shown above, is simply
```shell
wandb: Creating sweep from: path/to/sweep.yaml
wandb: Network error (ReadTimeout), entering retry loop.
```

the above runs without terminating, and continues creating new, identical sweeps from the .yaml config until the command is manually killed.
