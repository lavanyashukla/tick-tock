TITLE:
[Feature]: wandb agent --dryrun foobar

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

It would be a nice quality of life to have a `--dryrun` flag that would output the commands to be run by `wandb agent blahblah`
This would help users check if their `sweep.yaml` used for generating the sweep was created correctly.

The ideal workflow would be -

* prepare a sweep by creating a sweep config `sweep.yaml`
* `wandb sweep sweep.yaml` returns a sweep id `foobar`
* user checks if the commands are formatted correctly by running `wandb agent --dryrun foobar`
* if it all looks good, `wandb agent foobar`

### Suggested Solution

Here's a mockup for the expected output.
https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/wandb_agent.py already spits these out on the fly.
