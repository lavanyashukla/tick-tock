TITLE:
There should be an easier way to get default entity and project from Python

BODY:
`wandb.init()` reads the entity and project from the `wandb/settings` file if they are not specified. However, when using `wandb.Api()`, the functions fail if you don't specify the entity and project. It would be more intuitive if they would use the same default settings. Also, there is no documented way to get the default settings. I found a way, but it's not very elegant:
```python
entity = wandb.settings.Settings().get('default', 'entity')
project = wandb.settings.Settings().get('default', 'project')
```
