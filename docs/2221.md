BODY:
Hi, when I conduct experiments, I print too many things out. So I have many output.log files, each of them is 60MB to 400MB large in every run. I want to delete these output.log files but not the wandb-summary.json files.

1.  How could I quickly delete these output.log files? I have run thousands of experiments, it is too difficult to manually choose them and delete.
2. Could I choose not to upload output.log files in my python programs?
