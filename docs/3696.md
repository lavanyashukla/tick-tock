### Describe the bug

I'm running experiments on a cluster with offline mode.  At the end of the training, i log some images on a test set. When i do not have to restart the training, everything works fine. After restarting, however, the images aren't logged any more. 
I'm using wandb 0.12.4 and pytorch lightning 1.6.0

I've inspected the log folder and images are indeed logged in the wandb folder, but they don't seem to be uploaded when syncying.
