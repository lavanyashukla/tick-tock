### Description

Metrics that I log and then plot (training loss, validation loss, etc. against step or epoch) change values every time the plot is 'updated', even when a run is already finished (so no new values are being logged). So when I am plotting metrics which are from completed runs, the plot keeps changing every few seconds. Why does this happen?
