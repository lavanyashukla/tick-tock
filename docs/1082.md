BO and random search not exploring search space

### Description

I am doing a wandb sweep. The sweep config has only discrete values and a low space size of about 30 unique configurations.

Expectation: All 30 configurations are tested after each other.

Actually: A few configurations are tested multiple times, while others are not run at all.

I observe this both with BO and random search.
