### Description

What I want: log confusion matrix for multiclass predictions on the validation set after every epoch, and have them logged separately so I can flip through them

What happened: The numbers come up overlapped on a single plot:

### What I Did

I'm using it through the pytorch-lightning API. The `validation_epoch_end` method returns 

```
{ 'log': {'val_loss': mean_losses,
             'confusion_matrix': confusion_matrix(y, pred, atom_syms)}}
```

and the 'log' key is simply logged via the wandb run object. `confusion_matrix` is from wandb.sklearn.
