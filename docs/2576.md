**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Hi, I'm a great fan of Weights & Biases. Thank you for developing this amazing system.
I found one not-yet-supported feature which would make Weights & Biases even better: a way to rename and delete tags.
Tags can currently only be created but they cannot be renamed or deleted. Because of this, the list of tags gets really messy as users create more and more tags.

(This issue is closely related to https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1439, but I opened a new issue because the old issue remained stale for a long time.)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I think the way Notion lets the users manage the tags can be a plausible solution.
Each tag has a dropdown menu as well as the x button, and in the dropdown menu, users can rename the tag, delete it or change the color of the tag.

I think a similar UI can be adopted to Weights & Biases by creating a dropdown menu button next to the tags as marked in the screenshot below.

Indeed, such a feature is already supported in weights & biases for the runs. It would be really great if tags can also be managed in the same way.
