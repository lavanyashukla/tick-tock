TITLE:
Missing code file when using jupyter-lab

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:

* Python version: 3.7
* Operating System: docker, ubuntu, jupyter-lab

### Description

When using the attached notebook I get the following error:
```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/app/notebooks/wandb/run-20190815_122626-y9w00bpa/code/notebooks/wandb.ipynb'
```
When looking into the `/app/notebooks/wandb/run-20190815_122626-y9w00bpa/code/` directory, one can see that the file is indeed missing. It seems that wandb couldn't copy the current notebook file into the wandb directory.
Is there an error how I'm using wandb or is this a bug?

### What I Did
See notebook:
