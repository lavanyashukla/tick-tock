TITLE:
[CLI] wandb.watch leaks system memory (i.e. not gpu memory)

LABEL:
cli,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
System memory is stable during training, but large 1GB chunks are utilized shortly after taking checkpoints. When I comment out `wandb.watch(model)`, the issue goes away.

**Wandb features**
`init` `watch` `log` `lightning`

**How to reproduce**
