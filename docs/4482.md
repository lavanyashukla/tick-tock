[Q] How to resume a run from specific step?

Hi,
As mentioned in these #2236 #2234 issues, we need wandb to resume a run from specific step. 

We usually did not save checkpoint each step, so when we resume a run, the checkpoint is usually with old step compared with more frequent logs like "loss". We need to tell wandb to resume from a specific step in order to make the logging consistent.

The workaround by setting the step value in #2234 seems did not work:

```
wandb.log(dict, step=iteration)
```

I found the old value are not updated.

So, any update on this problem?
