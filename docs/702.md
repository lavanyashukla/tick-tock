Feature Request: Deleting runs via API

I am not sure where to post feature requests, I will move this request to the proper place if required. 

It would be useful for me to be able to delete a (non-local) run from within python. So far I have not found a way to do this (please let me know if there is one!). The typical use case is if my program encounters a run-time error, it may invalidate the run. In this case I want to remove the run completely and conveniently i.e. not have to go to the web interface and do it manually.

Thanks!
