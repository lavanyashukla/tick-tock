TITLE:
[CLI] `wandb.restore` restoring incorrect file

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
```python
import subprocess
import wandb
f = wandb.restore("checkpoint_49", "skainswo/playing-the-lottery/n83xc9z7")
subprocess.run(["md5sum", f.name])
```
prints `92819919bf3b9c9669d4b20ccfb711d6`, but if I download the file from https://wandb.ai/skainswo/playing-the-lottery/runs/n83xc9z7/files?workspace=user-skainswo I get a file which has the md5 hash `17709b8ae64414cbab216bd5487d00db`. By inspecting the two files I can tell that the downloaded file is correct and `wandb.restore` one is wrong.

Why is `wandb.restore` giving me the wrong file back?

**Wandb features**
See the example code above. I'm saving files into `wandb.run.dir` to get them uploaded in the script that created the original run.

**How to reproduce**
See example code above. The run should be public. Happy to provide any other information that may be helpful in debugging.

**Environment**
- OS: Linux 5.10.95, NixOS, 21.11 (Porcupine)
- Environment: Running in nix-shell with wandb 0.12.10.
- Python Version: 3.9.9
