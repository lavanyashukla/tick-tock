TITLE:
[Feature]: Visualization of scene of point clouds, meshes, and other 3d shapes over time

### Description

Based on the latest docs, wandb currently supports 3D visualizations for the these filetypes: `['obj', 'gltf', 'glb', 'babylon', 'stl', 'pts.json']`, as well as point clouds given as `nx3, nx4, nx6`.

It'd be nice to have a convenient way to do 3D scene visualizations over time (rather than a point cloud or mesh at a single instance in time).  

### Suggested Solution

Would like an API similar to:

```python
scene = wandb.3DScene()

timesteps = ...

# sequence of point clouds
pcd_sequence = ...

# sequence of meshes
vertices_sequence = ...
faces_sequence = ...

for i, t in enumerate(timesteps):
    # probably need another parameter for length, assuming inputs are padded
    scene.add_pointcloud(t=t, pcd_sequence[i,...])
    scene.add_mesh(t=t, v=vertices_sequence[i,...], f=faces_sequence[i,...])
```

Would also be nice to be able to log batches of 3d object sequences. 

### Alternatives

I've found that [meshplot](https://skoch9.github.io/meshplot/tutorial/) is the easiest for HTML visualization of meshes / point clouds. 

However, [kaolin](https://kaolin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/checkpoints.html) functionality is closer to the feature request, as they use [USD format](https://kaolin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/kaolin.visualize.html#kaolin.visualize.Timelapse.add_pointcloud_batch) to store the underlying scene over time.
