new wandb requires interactive prompt

BODY:
After upgrading wandb I found a bunch of my distributed workers hanging at the following prompt. Is there some python arg to get the old behavior? (ignore missing credentials with a warning)

```
Logging to run05
wandb: W&B is a tool that helps track and visualize machine learning experiments
wandb: (1) Create a W&B account
wandb: (2) Use an existing W&B account
wandb: (3) Don't visualize my results
```
