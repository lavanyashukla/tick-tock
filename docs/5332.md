### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

Since roughly two days ago, images are not syncing from python to the wandb backend properly. I didn't really change anything, at least nothing that I know of.

The image does not appear in "Files" on the webapp and in the "Media" tab, the following message appears:
`Select runs that logged image with the key test to visualize data here.`
In the local run diectory, the image is present ("files/media/images").

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
import wandb
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

wandb.init(project="test123", config={"test": 1})

fig = plt.figure()
plt.plot([1, 2, 3])
wandb.log({"test": wandb.Image(fig)})

wandb.finish()
```

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell

```
