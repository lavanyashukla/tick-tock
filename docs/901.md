### Description

I'm not sure if this is a bug ... 

I would expect that when passing config with nested dictionaries all nested dictionaries should be flattened recursively.

### What I Did
```
x = {'a': {'b': 'c'}}
wandb.init(project="xyz", config=x)

print(wandb.config.a.b)

Outputs:
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'b'
```
