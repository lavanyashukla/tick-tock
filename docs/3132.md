[Feature] Automatically update table of content in report' during editing

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Problem: In reports, the `/table of content` doesn't automatically update while editing. It only updates when I click "Save".

This is frustrating when I'm spending hours editing the report, and I don't want to keep clicking "Save". It would be great if the table of content updates live while editing.

**Steps to reproduce**
1. Create a report
2. Add a header "# My header 1"
3. Add `/table of content`
4. Add a header "# My header 2"

The table of content is not updated, unless I click "Save".

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Automatically updated table of content whenever I add/change the headers.

Applications such as [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) have this functionality.
