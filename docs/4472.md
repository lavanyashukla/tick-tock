TITLE:
[Feature]: Adding created timestamp to the run summary / config

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

Just like there is '_timestamp' to denote the current timestamp, it would be great if there is a key 'created_timestamp' that denotes the time as which the run was created. 

### Suggested Solution

I see this in the UI but not in the API. I'm currently getting this from the history and extracting the timestamp from the first entry.

### Alternatives
