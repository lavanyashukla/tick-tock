**Description**
It seems I'm getting an issue when trying to run distributed training on Sagemaker. 

I've taken a look at the [documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/distributed-training) regarding distributed training, and I'm trying to get the second approach to work, `wandb.init()` on all processes.

The training job fails with the exception
```
[1,3]<stderr>:  File "train.py", line 75, in <module>
[1,3]<stderr>:    group="DDP",
[1,3]<stderr>:  File "/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/wandb/sdk/wandb_init.py", line 846, in init
[1,3]<stderr>:    six.raise_from(Exception("problem"), error_seen)
[1,3]<stderr>:  File "<string>", line 3, in raise_from
[1,3]<stderr>:Exception: problem
```

I've created a repository to recreate the issue: https://github.com/jambran/wandb_sagemaker_bug_report

Thank you very much in advance. I'd like to continue using `wandb` while running distributed training!

**Wandb features**
`wandb.init()` with `HuggingfaceEstimator` from sagemaker
