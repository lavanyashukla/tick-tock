[Feature]: short run names

### Description

The quirky run names are cute but get annoying after a while.

It's a _lot_ of visual clutter:

And since they're different lengths, it makes scanning the list to find a particular run more difficult than it needs to be.

I understand I can use the API to get a count of the runs in my project and craft my own run name, but this requires an additional network request before running my code, not to mention the added complexity.

### Suggested Solution

Option 1:
Allow the user to request terse run names. I think `run-1`, `run-2`, etc is reasonable. `v1`, `v2` are also perfectly functional - why not let the beautiful charts be the focus of attention, not a bunch of random words.
```py
wandb.init(fancy_names=False)
```

Option 2:
Allow the user to specify how to construct the name, like:
```py
wandb.init(name=lambda counter: f"run-{counter}")
```

Or perhaps in the format `name = "run-{counter}"`, which you can then fill out with `name.format(counter=12)` (if this is being done in Python somewhere, or just string replace if being done in some other language).

### Alternatives

The only alternatives I can see at the moment are either slowing down my code by fetching and counting all the runs in my project before the real work starts, or putting up with the word soup, or logging with timestamps which are less readable and hard to talk about.
