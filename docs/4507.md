TITLE:
[Feature]: Enable silent mode for artifact downloads

LABEL:
feature_request,c:artifacts

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Description

`Artifact.download` always prints to stdout a message about the number of files downloaded. There isn't a way to silence these messages as far as I know:

```
wandb:   2 of 2 files downloaded. 
```

I run jobs to download artifacts from many runs at one time, so I'd like to silence the printing to stdout.
 
### Suggested Solution

The `WANDB_SILENT` environmental variable should also apply to artifact downloads.

### Alternatives

There could also be an option in the `download` method for artifacts for silencing standard output (e.g., `silent=True`).

### Additional Context

I'm guessing the change would go here? If it's a simple change, I'm happy to submit a PR.
