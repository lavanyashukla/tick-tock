### Description

Seeing progress in the later stages of learning is often more interesting to inspect on a log-scale for the step/epoch.

### Suggested Solution

In the x-axis selector widget on top (next to the search panels field), have a quick toggle for making the horizontal axis logarithmic.

### Alternatives

Right now, I have to go manually set every chart manually on log-scale for the x-axis.

### Additional Context
