**Describe the bug**
When I log multiple images with the same key, the images show up in the UI as overlapped.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Log image with same key over multiple steps
2. See images from those steps shown in UI as one image, each image overlapped on top of each other. 

**Expected behavior**
Each step should have one image that I can see with the step slider.
