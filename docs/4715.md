[CLI]: `.setLevel(logging.WARNING)` is ignored

### Describe the bug

The docs suggest that the following snippet can be used to [turn off logging](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/environment-variables#turn-off-logging):
```py
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger("wandb")
logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)
```

But it seems that some places in the code used `click` for logging, which doesn't respect this.

Also, since 'click' prints to `sys.stderr`, it is coloured an awful red by default (a feature of PyCharm). Note in this screenshot that other packages adhere to the color scheme I have set (INFO=grey, print=white, etc) but wandb logs are all red.

It would be great if I could use wandb without getting so much logged to my console, and even better if wandb would use loggers in the conventional way which allows users to control the noise.

Maybe there's a setting somewhere that I've missed?
