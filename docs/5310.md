### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

I was using wandb without problems. I had to change my project to another directory and create a new environment. now when trying to use wandb with the following bash file I get wandb command not found, this is the bash file:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH --partition=batch
##SBATCH --array=1-100%5
#SBATCH -J KNN
#SBATCH -o /ibex/user/fonsecv/Machine_Learning_Course/Notebooks/Notebooks/KNN/output/KNN_Job.%J.out
#SBATCH -e /ibex/user/fonsecv/Machine_Learning_Course/Notebooks/Notebooks/KNN/output/KNN_Job.%J.err
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00
#SBATCH --mem=150G
#SBATCH --reservation=A100
#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=a100:1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --constraint=[gpu]

# Set environment variables
source activate MyDefaultA100

# Run the application
wandb --version

I've uninstalled wandb reinstall it again and logged in, but the issue persists. I can call wandb from the command line, but not using the bash file. if I request v100 gpu in my older environment (instead of a100) it works, it also works with v100 in the new environment but not with a100 in none of the environments, which makes me think probably it's not wandb related but not sure.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python

```shell

```I just get this as output in the output.err file:
