[Q] How do I access a saved table form a completed run?

LABEL:

BODY:
Hi, I have saved a table "doc_topic_map" during a run and I can see it in the UI but how do I retrieve the contents of the table from a python notebook?

run.summary["doc_topic_map"] gives me the _latest_artifact_path but if I try to pass that to the run.use_artifact() function, it errors - 
"CommError: You must pass a wandb.Api().artifact() to use_artifact"

Using the below line (after filling in the run id and table name) also results in the same error:
run.use_artifact("run-RUN_ID-table_name:v3").get("table_name")

Note: The run was completed in a previous session.
