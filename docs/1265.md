TITLE:
Logging shows progress bar at each update

LABEL:
feature_request,c:console

STATE:
open

BODY:
The Logs page under a W&B run shows a separate line for each update of a tqdm progress bar. This makes it challenging to find desired logs in the mix, since the number of updates to a progress bar is often equal to the number of training batches, which can reach millions. Since progress bars are commonly used in deep learning libraries (e.g. Pytorch Lightning) to track training, it would be great to have tqdm progress bars logged as they are displayed on the command line or to suggest a workaround to filter out or disable logging of progress bar updates.
