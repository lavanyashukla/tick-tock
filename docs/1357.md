TITLE:
Logs not syncing when wandb-history.jsonl is quite large.

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
When I run `wandb sync wandb/my_run` the history metrics are not uploaded to the wandboard. It just stays like that till I kill the command with Ctrl+C.

The folder `wandb/my_run` contains the following contents:
```

2.4K  config.yaml
402K  model.ckpt
9.6M  output.log
748K  wandb-events.jsonl
62M  wandb-history.jsonl
16B  wandb-metadata.json
61K  wandb-summary.json
```

The output I get after running `wandb sync wandb/my_run`:
```
wandb: Syncing wandb/my_run to:
wandb: exp_name https://app.wandb.ai/usr_name/project_name/runs/hash
wandb: Uploading history metrics
```
and after that it does not progress.

Does wandb sync have limits in upload sizes.
