[Q] visualizing pairwise cosine similarity of embeddings

Hello! I've recently started using W&B and I have a question: does W&B offer native tools to visualize pairwise cosine similarity? I want to get a picture like this one:
<img width="1123" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36272321/184406792-3e38f12e-c10c-460e-abef-60ba12fe9e8d.png">

For now, I'm using matplotlib for drawing such pictures and then log them like this:
```python
plt.imshow(similarity)
plt.colorbar()
wandb.log({'similarity': plt})
```

I found such thing as ```wandb.plots.HeatMap```, but it's marked as deprecated.

Thanks!
