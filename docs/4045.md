TITLE:
[Feature]: Ignore Underscored Keys in Runs Comparer

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

When comparing runs it would be awesome if I can ignore the diffs in some keys, by prefixing them with an underscore, like I can do in the overview page of a run (for summary and config attributes).  
Sometimes I have keys that the diff between them is obvious, like "name", "tags", "output folder", etc.


### Suggested Solution

add the button in the overview page:

in the run comparer panel:

### Alternatives

juts ignore those keys when comparing :sweat_smile:   
but when I want to show the reports to someone it's just a hassle going through meaningless differences (and I hope it's a relatively simple filter to incorporate)
