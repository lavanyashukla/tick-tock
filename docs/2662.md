[Q] Is there a way to combine runs from different `wandb local` into a single one?

Hello,

I'm trying to aggregate the runs I collected with different `wandb local` instances into a single one, so that I can look at all my runs simultaneously.

Is there a simple way to do that? Also, could I run wandb in an offline mode and then somehow add up the collected runs in a folder and then run `wandb local` on it?
