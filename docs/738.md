TITLE:
Performance: opening group in table is slow

From Clemens Winter:

When I set runs to be grouped and then click on one of the arrows to expand a grouping of runs to the full list, the arrow will spin for ~1 second before the full list of runs is displayed. I strongly suspect there is a way of making this happen instantaneously instead.
