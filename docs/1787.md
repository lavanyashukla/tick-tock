TITLE:
Resuming grid sweep does not launch missing runs

LABEL:
c:sweeps

STATE:
open

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
After removing some runs from a completed grid sweep and resuming the sweep, no new runs are passed to the agents and the sweep goes back into the complete state.

This is in contrast to the documentation which describes that the missing configurations will be launched when the sweep is resumed: https://docs.wandb.ai/sweeps/faq#rerun-grid-search

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a sweep for example:
```yaml
method: grid
parameters:
  batch_size:
    values:
    - 20
program: train.py
```
2. Launch an agents for the sweep
3. Remove the entry of the run when completed
4. Resume the sweep
5. Launch a new agent to run the missing sweep
6. Wandb agent will give the following output
```
wandb: Starting wandb agent :sleuth_or_spy:
2021-02-01 21:32:51,562 - wandb.wandb_agent - INFO - Running runs: []
2021-02-01 21:32:51,915 - wandb.wandb_agent - INFO - Agent received command: exit
2021-02-01 21:32:51,915 - wandb.wandb_agent - INFO - Received exit command. Killing runs and quitting.
wandb: Terminating and syncing runs. Press ctrl-c to kill.
```
7. The state of the sweep will go back to `completed`

**Expected behavior**
The missing sweep should be run by the agent after it has been deleted from the sweep.
