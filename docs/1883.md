**Description**
I'm trying to setup my first sweep run. When I run `wandb sweep training/sweep.yaml` I get prompted to enter my API key (doesn't seem to pick up from my machine). It then tries to create a sweep but throws an error that the sweep user is not valid. My API key works for my normal wandb logging.

**Step 1: I'm prompted to enter my API Key**
```
wandb sweep training/sweep.yaml
wandb: Login to W&B to use the sweep feature
wandb: You can find your API key in your browser here: https://wandb.ai/authorize
wandb: Paste an API key from your profile and hit enter: 
```
**Step 2: Get the following error message**
```
wandb: Appending key for api.wandb.ai to your netrc file: /Users/nohara/.netrc
wandb: Creating sweep from: training/sweep.yaml
400 response executing GraphQL.
{"errors":[{"message":"Sweep user not valid","path":["upsertSweep"]}],"data":{"upsertSweep":null}}
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: Sweep user not valid (<Response [400]>)
