TITLE:
[Feature]: Cumulative Functions of metrics

LABEL:

BODY:
### Description

I often realize after the fact that I would like to track functions of some logged metrics. One example is "best loss" or "best accuracy" so far, ie the running min/max of a the logged metric.

### Suggested Solution

In the X box or the Y box of a chart, it would be great to be able to type `max(val_accuracy)` or `min(val_loss)`, and have the API compute the cumulative min/max.

### Alternatives

The alternative is for the user to think of everything before hand. But it would be helpful to apply these functions on previous runs as well, since the computation is easy.
Currently, the "Expressions" tab allows computing element wise functions of the metric, but not cumulative functions.
