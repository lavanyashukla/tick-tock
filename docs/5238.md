[CLI]: wandb.init is altering my flags (Tensorflow)

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
I have some tensorflow (no keras) code I have to use and it has a function (A) that is called before training starts, altering some of the flags. This works fine without wandb but when I try to pass the FLAGS object as the wandb init config the FLAGS are altered. It resets them to the state they were in before being altered by the function A. No idea why this might happen...

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
FLAGS = tf.app.flags.FLAGS
config_and_print_log(FLAGS) # A: alters flags
wandb.init(project='TF-DNet', config=FLAGS)
```
