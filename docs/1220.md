### Description
use my computer as a server
use another computer with wandb as normal, wandb.log works but code cannot be saved and there is one error for one file to be uploaded.
wandb: ERROR Error uploading "config.yaml": CommError, Whoa, you found a bug.
wandb: ERROR Error uploading "requirements.txt": CommError, Whoa, you found a bug.
wandb: ERROR Error uploading "output.log": CommError, Whoa, you found a bug.
wandb: ERROR Error uploading "wandb-metadata.json": CommError, Whoa, you found a bug.
wandb: ERROR Error uploading "config.yaml": CommError, Whoa, you found a bug.
wandb: ERROR Error uploading "wandb-summary.json": CommError, Whoa, you found a bug


I think it is not the problem of connection because the log data can be uploaded, but why files cannot be uploaded.
