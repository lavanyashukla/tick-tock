Match the name of the experiment with the run directory on local stroage 

LABEL:

BODY:
I'd also like to ask if there is an option to match the name of the experiment in the app with the run directory on local storage? For example: a run has set up name major-flower-16 in the app but in the directory it is named /run-20191004_153526-jnhxw865.
