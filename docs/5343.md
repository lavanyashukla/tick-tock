TITLE:
[App]: Scatterplot does not show data with missing-value labels

LABEL:
app

STATE:
closed

BODY:
### Current Behavior

Scatterplot **does not** show run data whose "Labels" values have a missing value.

### Expected Behavior

Scatterplot **shows** run data whose "Labels" values have a missing value. The missing value is denoted with "N/A" or with a dash (like in the Table).

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Have several runs with a config parameter or a summary metric, such that some runs **have** this parameter and some other runs **do not have** this parameter. Such a situation occurs naturally when the model structure is modified, and a new parameter is added to the config to reflect the change. For example, one may add a preprocessing step.
2. Go to Workspace.
3. Create a Scatter plot in such a way that it shows all runs.
4. In the "Labels" Tab of the Scatter plot, add the parameter or metric that has missing values.
5. Observe that some datapoints disappear.

### Environment

Browsers:
Firefox


### Additional Context

It is understandable that data points are not drawn when X, Y or Z values are N/A. I don't see any reason for not drawing datapoints with N/A in Labels (Legend Fields, tooltips).
