### Description

I was wondering if there was a way to share a link to my runs while hiding the group name. This would allow me to share wandb links with reviewers for double-blind conferences (ICLR, ICML, NeurIPS, etc). It looks like there are already some anonymous capabilities in wandb, but this seems like it's more for having others contribute runs anonymously, rather than share existing runs anonymously.

### Suggested Solution

Would love a button in the GUI that says "share this project anonymously" that produces a link where the team/user names are hidden.
