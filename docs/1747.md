TITLE:
[CLI] Metrics of sweep runs are not shown with id in wandb.init

LABEL:
stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
The metrics used for hyperparameter optimisation with sweeps are not logged when id is passed to `wandb.init` method. Individual runs do not show their metrics either.

**How to reproduce**
Example of a run with such bug: https://wandb.ai/freefeynman123/ifsl-MTL_sweeps/sweeps/q9fxzeuo?workspace=user-freefeynman123

The code for this project can be viewed in: https://github.com/freefeynman123/ifsl/tree/develop

You can view `MTL/trainer/meta.py` for details of given code.

After changing the line 
`self.run_train = wandb.init(project=self.args.project_name, id=id, resume="allow", job_type='train', entity=USER_NAME)` 
to 
`self.run_train = wandb.init(project=self.args.project_name, resume="allow", job_type='train', entity=USER_NAME)`
(essentially deleting id from `wandb.init`)

the metrics are shown, however tracking individual runs is lost and one cannot retrieve artifacts for given run.

**Environment**
- Docker base image: nvidia/cuda:11.1.1-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu20.04
- Environment: Kubernetes pod with RTX2080 GPU
- Python Version: 3.8.5
