TITLE:
[Q] Separate Slack channel for each project

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I have 3 different projects currently going on and all are being tracked on wandb. I want to alert some metrics and run information to slack channels. But, in documentation, it seems like we can only use one slack channel for each account. Is there any way to use separate slack channels for all 3 different projects, so it will be much easier to track?
