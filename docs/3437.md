### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
Hi, I'm currently working on a group-shared Linux machine, which means the authority setting is pretty strict. I think the issue is mainly caused because I don't have enough permission. However, I just wonder is this log directory customizable? Or maybe can I disable this logging completely?

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
Â» wandb
Traceback (most recent call last):

    return open(self.baseFilename, self.mode, encoding=self.encoding)
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/tmp/debug-cli.log'
```
Just a few additional info:
- I do check the permission of `/tmp` and it's `drwxrwxrwt  358 root    root    2.3M Mar 29 10:50 tmp`, and I think the permission looks enough to me.
- I try `touch /tmp/debug-cli`, it works, but `touch /tmp/debug-cli.log` does trigger a permission denied, if anyone knows how to correct the permission, it'll also be appreciated.
