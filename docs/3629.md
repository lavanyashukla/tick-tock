[Feature]: Add a flag to keep wandb-resume.json after finishing

### Description

I'm have a bash script that calls my training code (e.g. `python main.py --args`) a few times in one script with different parameters, one set of parameters per run. I would like to be able to call this script a second time, and have it skip over runs that have already finished. I'm using `wandb.init(resume=True)` so I don't have to keep track of the run IDs myself (specifically this is for a colleague who is running things for me and we have many many runs). The problem is that `wandb/wandb-resume.json` is removed when a run is finished. So when I call the program a second time and tell it to output to the same directory as the first time, it starts a new run instead of detecting it has finished and exists.

### Suggested Solution

Can we add an option to keep the `wandb/wandb-resume.json` file to essentially "force" the run to be resumed without needing to provide an explicit run ID? I know you have the `resume=must` option but that requires the run ID.
