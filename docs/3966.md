TITLE:
[CLI]: wandb.log logs lists as histograms. 

LABEL:
c:core,cli

STATE:
open

BODY:
When logging a list of values to wandb with wandb.log the list is resolved as a histogram. Upon querying finished runs I can only retrieve the histogram format, not the underlying data.

```python 
wandb.log({'predictions': [1,2,3,4,...]}) 
run.finish()
-- later:
api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("run_id")
run.summary['predictions'] # <-- This returns a histogram format of the data
```

This is really bad for us because for further analysis the order and values of the original data matters. Is there a way to work around this? I know I can make a Table but generating a table with one column is a really ugly workaround. I am struggling with processing tables as well (how can I for instance generate a pandas DataFrame from a Table?)

The workaround for this looks like that but is not super nice:

```python
data_dict = {'predictions: pd.Series([1,2,3,4])}
table = wandb.Table(dataframe=pd.DataFrame(data_dict))
run.log({'results': table})
-- later
api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("run_id")
artifact = run.logged_artifacts()[0]
table = artifact.get("results")
dict_table = {column: table.get_column(column) for column in table.columns}
df = pd.DataFrame(dict_table)
```
