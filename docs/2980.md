TITLE:
[App] Sweep does not re-run failed runs, even after deleting

LABEL:
app

STATE:
closed

BODY:
When I create a sweep grid search, I want to explore all possible parameter configurations. Sometimes however, some runs fail because of an implementation bug or just due to network issues. When I delete these failed runs from the sweep while it is running, these runs will not be repeated. As soon as the sweep reaches the predefined number of runs, it will go on "pause" mode. Then after reactivating the sweep, the remaining runs will be finished. This is increasingly annoying since I often fix bugs on the fly and expect failed runs to be completed when I delete them from the already running sweep.

Interestingly, I did not observe this behaviour a couple months ago - I feel like this must have changed with a recent update.
Best,
