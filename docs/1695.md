**Describe the bug**
When logging model artifact saved in .pth ot .h5 format, I encountered the following issue:

```

After all the model is saved in artifacts and seems to work fine, however it may be corrupted in some way and the log looks just terrible.

**To Reproduce**
```
id = wandb.util.generate_id()        
run_train = wandb.init(project=args.project_name, id=id, resume="allow", job_type='train')
torch.save(dict(params=model.state_dict()), os.path.join(args.save_path, name + '.h5'))
artifact = wandb.Artifact(type='model', name=args.model_type)
artifact.add_file(os.path.join(args.save_path, name + '.h5'))
run_train.log_artifact(artifact)
```

**Expected behavior**
No error in log

**Operating System**
 - OS: Ubuntu (running on k8s cluster with nvidia/cuda:10.1-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu18.04 base image)
 - Browser: Chrome
 - Version: 87.0.4280.88 (Official Build) (64-bit)

Edit: After downgrading to version 0.9.5 of wandb everything seems to work fine.
