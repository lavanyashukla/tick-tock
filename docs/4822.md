### Description

At the moment when exporting the data from wandb either in` .csv, .svg, .pdf `format data is saved with the name involving the current timestamp (i.e wandb_export_2023-01-23T18 48 34.631+03 00.csv ) without the option of changing it. And one needs to find that table and edit the name manually after downloading. Hardly one is able to understand what is located under this name without opening the data.

### Suggested Solution

I think it would be useful to add an option to change the name of saved plot or table, i.e `save as` with the editable text field.
