[Q]AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_global_run_stack'

Explanation:

This error appeared while I was building and training a model using efficientnet via timm.
It happened when I built an array like [0], a string in the scheduler.
By the way, 
I had no problem with the hyperparameters, which are just numbers.

Does it not support anything other than numbers?
Or is there a way to do something like these as well?
Thank you very much for your help.
