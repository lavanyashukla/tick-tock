TITLE:
[CLI] wandb sync --id=3ry7a3m2 syncs all experiments instead of the provided one

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
`wandb --version && python --version && uname`

* Weights and Biases version: 0.8.36
* Python version: 3.7.6
* Operating System: Debian 9.0

### Description

I modified `wandb-summary.json` locally and want to upload my changes. I'm probably missing something from the CLI docs, but no matter what command combination I try, I keep uploading all the runs instead of just the provided one. 

Docs from CLI:
```
wandb sync --help

Usage: wandb sync [OPTIONS] [PATH]...

  Upload an offline training directory to W&B

Options:
  --id TEXT           The run you want to upload to.
  -p, --project TEXT  The project you want to upload to.
  -e, --entity TEXT   The entity to scope to.
  --ignore TEXT       A comma seperated list of globs to ignore syncing with
                      wandb.

  --help              Show this message and exit.
```

### What I Did

I tried with all the following commands, and the result was always the same: wandb would upload all the runs on my local directory. There is a folder `wandb`  and a run inside it under the folder `run-20200602_150630-3ry7a3m2` from where the command was invoked.

Commands I tried:
```
wandb sync --id=3ry7a3m2
wandb sync --id=3ry7a3m2 wandb/
wandb sync --id 3ry7a3m2 wandb/
wandb sync --id=3ry7a3m2 wandb/
wandb sync --id "3ry7a3m2"
wandb sync --id '3ry7a3m2'
wandb sync --id '3ry7a3m2' wandb/
wandb sync --id='3ry7a3m2' wandb/
wandb sync --id="3ry7a3m2" wandb/

```

Am I missing anything?

Thanks,
Sebastian
