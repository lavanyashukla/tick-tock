TITLE:
[Feature] Multiple histograms [x: step, y:bin] on the same panel

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Problem:**
I would like to track how two distributions (positive and negative classifications over scores between -1 and 1) evolve during training

**Solution I'd like:**
It would be nice if it was possible to show both of them in the same histogram plot with [x:step, y:bin] with different colors.
This would be useful to check the overlap area between the two.
The plot would be exactly like the one already available in the run page, just with two different sets for the Y axis.
