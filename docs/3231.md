[Feature] Compare my metric against someone else's *public* metric in a report

I would like to compare the metrics of my experiment against someone else's *public* metrics. 

For example, [bmazoure](https://wandb.ai/bmazoure) has a [benchmark project](https://wandb.ai/bmazoure/ppo_procgen_jax/reports/PPO-Procgen-JAX-version---VmlldzoxMDM4MjAx) that shows the performance of PPO in procgen environments. When I implemented my own PPO, I want to compare my results with his results directly in a report since 
1. his results are already tracked in W&B, 
2. his W&B project is public and so is the results,
3.  I don't want to re-run his experiments in my projects (could be a waste of resources).

Currently, I can do this via a bit of hack:
* I can clone their report into my project
* Add my project into the panel grid's run set
* (IMPORTANT) de-select their run set (if I don't do this, I cannot select metrics from my own project when adding a chart)
* Add a chart from my project
* Compare (woohoo!)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The process is a bit convoluted and most people probably don't know. Ideally, I should be able to add a run set from an arbitrary public project.
