TITLE:
[Feature] More flexibility in customized curves' expressions

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
**Issue**

- It is possible to modify axis through expressions, but if we have many curves on the same plot is not possible to add a different axis' customization for each of them; this is very annoying
- it is possible to add multiple expressions for the y-axis but not for the x-axis

**Proposed solution**
To solve both the above problem, It'd be very helpful to be able to associate (in the expression's chart menu) expressions to single independent groups of run and put many 'customized' group's plots on the same chart

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
For now the alternative I'm using is to apply each expression on each group. This is very unpractical because I get a lot of useless curves that make the representation less clear. Plus in this way is not possible to change x-axis expression for different plot on the same chart

**Additional context**
To have a more precise description of the problem it was discussed in [this post](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/3057)
