TITLE:
[Q] transfer run to another account

BODY:
Hi, I have two accounts `A` and `B`. `A` has some runs. `B` is a new account using a local server.

Is it possible to transfer runs from `A` to `B`? Either using GUI button (if any), or writing some code?

I've been trying to download all files from a run. But the downloaded files don't seem to include the loss curve data. It's also unclear how to upload these files (and whether these files suffice) to become a new run in account `B`.
```
import wandb
api = wandb.Api()

run = api.run("<entity>/<project>/<run_id>")
for file in run.files():
    file.download()
```
