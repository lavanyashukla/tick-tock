TITLE:
[Feature]: Sort by smoothed metric

BODY:
### Description

Sometimes the measurement of a metric can be a quite noisy estimate of the true value. In the plots this can be accounted for using smoothing. However, if you want to find the best run, it's not possible to sort by a smoothed metric.

### Suggested Solution

I would suggest to add a smoothing button in the sort menu that allows for sorting by a smoothed version of that metric.

### Alternatives

The alternative would be to manually calculate the smoothed metric during the run or later on by loading the data from the API. However, this is a significant amount of manual effort and it would be nicer to have this integrated right into W&B.
