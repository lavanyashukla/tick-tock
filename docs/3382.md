TITLE:
[Q] How can I configure the hostname to access from the client side

Hi all,

I am running Jypiter server in a docker container and wanted to use W&B with local hosting. However, the local hosting exposes the `localhost:8080` while the client's default configuration after initialization seems to be:
```
machine api.wandb.ai
  login user
  password <api-key>
```
and the host where the actual server service is running in the case of default docker configuration is `172.17.0.1`. I tried overwriting this config but this doesn't improve the fact that I get "Permission denied" in the internal debug log and from what I can see the client keeps trying to connect to the remote cloud API address instead and always fails at the `wandb.init(project="X", entity="Y")` stage. Is there a way to configure the hostname in order to make the client work well from within a docker container on the same host?
