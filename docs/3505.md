### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

`_disable_stats` doesn't work. `wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(_disable_stats=True))` It still sends stats to WANDB, which in turn leads to BSOD due to incompatibility with the old PYNVML dependency in the vendor folder in very specific scenarios.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```
wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(_disable_stats=True))
```

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
None
