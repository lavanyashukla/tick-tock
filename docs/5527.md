TITLE:
[CLI]: Can't log from multiple threads

### Describe the bug

My code runs on 2 threads, one for training and one for testing. I need to log training and testing stats at the same time, and I try to do that by calling `wandb.log()` in the training and testing function. However, only the thread that calls first `wandb.log()` will successfully log stats. The other thread log will be ignored.  
If you submit first the training function, you will have always have training stats. 

Here is a MWE. If you try it will always log testing stats, because they are started first. Sometimes (out of luck?) it also logs main stats. Sometimes (veeeery rarely) I get all 3 logs, but incomplete.

I have read somewhere that WandB is not thread safe, but in this case it is not even logging anything and it's behavior is completely non-deterministic. 

```python
import torch
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import wandb
import time

def run():
    wandb.init(
        entity='sparisi',
        project='abcd',
        mode='online',
    )

    done_train = False
    done_test = False

    def test():
        nonlocal done_test
        for i in range(100):
            wandb.log({'test': torch.rand(1).item()}, step=i, commit=True)
        done_test = True

    def train():
        nonlocal done_train
        for i in range(100):
            wandb.log({'train': torch.rand(1).item()}, step=i, commit=True)
        done_train = True

    thread_test = ThreadPoolExecutor(1)
    thread_train = ThreadPoolExecutor(1)
    thread_test.submit(test)
    thread_train.submit(train)

    for i in range(100):
        wandb.log({'main': torch.rand(1).item()}, step=i, commit=True)

    while not done_test and not done_train:
        time.sleep(0.1)

    wandb.finish()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()

```
