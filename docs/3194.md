TITLE:
[App] Cannot operate with more than 100 experiments

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
I have 503 experiments in one job tab. But I can scroll them only up to 100 experiments in the lower scrolling bar. Therefore my other 400 experiments remain unaccessible.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to 'Table tab'
2. Have more than 100 experiments for one job type
3. Scroll until 100 experiments then see that you cannot scroll further.
4. Error!

**Expected behavior**
I would expect to be able to open let us say 200-th experiment.
