TITLE:
[App]: Is there a limit for table logging?

### Current Behavior

I have created a custom table as shown in the image. As you can see it is logged 82 times on the left side and it is completely selected. But the table on the right shows only 50 rows. Even exporting it to .csv shows only 50 rows. 

I was wondering if is there a limit for logging for tables and how one can bypass it.

Thanks a million.


### Expected Behavior

The full log should be displayed in the table and exported to CSV. 

### Steps To Reproduce
