TITLE:
Initializing wandb prevents parallel processes from throwing errors

LABEL:

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
When running parallel processing using torch.multiprocessing initializing wandb prevents the program from throwing errors and stopping the program.

**To Reproduce**
Minimal example:

```
import torch
import wandb

def main(rank):
    wandb.init()
    raise ValueError

if __name__ == "__main__":
    torch.multiprocessing.spawn(main, nprocs=4, args=())
```

**Expected behavior**
The program should throw an error and stop running. When I remove wandb.init() from the above example, it behaves as expected.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Linux

Edit:
Additional comment: `wandb.init()` prevents the processes from stopping altogether. When I remove `raise ValueError` the program does not stop either.
