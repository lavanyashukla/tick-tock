TITLE:
[Feature]: Grouping columns by parent in a table

LABEL:
feature_request,app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Description

Some parameters are directly linked to the higher groups and it makes the most sense to see them together.

For example, if I can group the augmentation parameters only by name under the augmentation main column, if I can activate and deactivate that group when I need it, the table view will be much easier for me. Currently, tables are unreadable in trainings with crowded configurations. There are perhaps hundreds of columns going to the right.

The new column view should be able to be turned on and off by those who want it, so that developers who want the old usage should integrate easily.

In addition, the a/b/c/d feature used in graphic grouping can also come here and groups of certain depth should be created.

### Suggested Solution

Example table should look like below

![new_cols](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49915636/217489319-22fd9d46-7bd5-4b41-88c1-41f3daee23ca.png)

Old view (Current)

![old_cols](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49915636/217489409-a1e85e91-148f-4783-a479-889346c77e2e.png)
