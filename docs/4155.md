[Q] The wandb backend process has shutdown

I frequently run into the issue that my training crashes with the following error: 

```
  File "/home/emi/Projects/authory-page-extraction-ml/deep-model/virtual_env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/sdk/interface/interface_queue.py", line 49, in _publish
    raise Exception("The wandb backend process has shutdown")
Exception: The wandb backend process has shutdown

Exception: The wandb backend process has shutdown
```

I guess it might be related to network connectivity. 

However, is there a way for wandb to gracefully recover from this error without terminating the training process?
