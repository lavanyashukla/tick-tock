### Description

Hi wandb community. 

As far as I know one can download the csv data of a plot or export a table to csv. However, I am wondering if there can be any feature that lets researchers and machine learning practitioners download the whole data that is bound to one of their experiments maybe in a pickle maybe in a python dictionary format?

something like:
{(step:1, loss: 120), (step:2, loss:80)}

### Suggested Solution

Let the user download their data.
