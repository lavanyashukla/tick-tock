Hi, thanks for this excellent product! 

 I tried to log a histogram, but find that the plot only contains part of the data points. Here are my steps: Firstly I created a wandb `Table` object with the data that I want to plot. Then I use `wandb.plot.histogram` to plot the data. But I find the histogram only contains part of the data in the Table object.

The code is as follows,
```{Python}
prob1_data = [[ID_train[i], losses[i]] for i in range(len(ID_train))]
print(len(prob1_data))  #37,115
table1 = wandb.Table(data=prob1_data, columns=['IDs', 'losses'])
wandb.log({
'losses_distribution_for_model1': wandb.plot.histogram(table1, 'losses', title="losses for model1"),
})
```


Here is the screenshot of the histogram (you can see that there are only a few thousand data points):

Here is the screenshot of the table (there are 37,115 data points):

Could you please take a look? Thank you very much!
