TITLE:
[CLI] Sweep on SLURM sbatch error: signal only works in main thread of the main interpreter

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
Running a sweep agent from a python script with wandb.agent results in a correct call of the training function but then at some point an error occurs:
```
Set SLURM handle signals.
wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish, PID 1931794
wandb: Program failed with code 1.  Press ctrl-c to abort syncing.

```

I noticed this error only occurs from an sbatch. Running the sweep from an srun works fine!
`signal only works in main thread of the main interpreter` is still printed to std out but there is no error and the training script keeps running.

**Wandb features**
wandb.agent()

**How to reproduce**
My training script cannot be shared. As soon as I have found the time to create a simple reproduction script I will update the issue.

**Environment**
- OS: [CentOS Linux]
- Environment: [e.g. conda, SLURM]
- Python Version: [eg. 3.9]
