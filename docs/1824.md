Hi, thank you very much for this amazing tool!
I have a question: when logging from different threads, I get a RuntimeError: "dictionary changed size during iteration", see also this pull request: [https://github.com/wandb/client/pull/110](https://github.com/wandb/client/pull/110).
I have found a workaround, I share it here, it might be helpful to others. The solution for me was to log with wandb in one thread and with tensorboard in the other thread, and of course setting `sync_tensorboard=True`. 
My question for the future: is there a better way to deal with multithreading logging?
Thank you again!
Eugenio
