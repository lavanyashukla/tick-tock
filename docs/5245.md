TITLE:
[Q] How to plot differences between runs?

BODY:
I'm working with a third party project.

I have 4 runs that together compose one training. They are: Pre-Training, eval1, Fine-Tuning, eval2. I have multiple iterations of this, each identified by a flag `training_ID`. The evals log scalar values for mAP (and others), evaluating the training after which they come. 

I want to plot the increase in mAP that is effected by the Fine-Tuning as a box plot.

I have a Weave query that would do this if it was accepted:
```
runs.filter((row) => row.config["__flags.feat_layer"] == "PreLogits_mean,PreLogits_sig").summary["map"].map((rowM, index) =>
{rowM - runs.filter((row2) => row2.config["__flags.feat_layer"] == "PreLogits").summary["map"][index]})
```
(the feat_layer is used to determine eval1 vs eval2)

Why is this not accepted?
Why is the documentation for Weave so abysmal?

How can I achieve this?
