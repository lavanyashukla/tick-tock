Multiple runs in notebook cells are not properly synced (wrong "state" for all but last)

### Description

I'm trying to execute several runs from a single cell in a Jupyter Notebook (for example, doing cross-validation with each split as a separate run.)

All runs execute and their results are logged, however, only the last run shows up as being `finished` â€” all earlier runs still show as `running` (until they are registered as `crashed` some time later).

I would expect all successfully completed runs to have state `finished`.

(When running from a script, everything works fine.)

### What I Did

A small example to illustrate the problem:

```
import wandb
import time

for i in range(10):
    with wandb.init(project="sandbox", name=f"wandb-test-{i + 1}", reinit=True) as run:
        run.summary['accuracy'] = (i + 1) / 10
        time.sleep(5)
```

Running this in a notebook cell results in the last run ("wandb-test-10") having state `finished`, but runs "wandb-test-1" through "wandb-test-9" still show up as `running`.

If instead the same code is run outside of a notebook in a separate script, all runs are correctly registered as being `finished`.
