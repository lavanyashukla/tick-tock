BODY:
**Describe the bug**
Using the Python Debugger along with W&B causes the interactive shell of the debugger to malfunction. It works, but you can no longer use keys like backspace, <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>(something)</kbd>, etc.

**To Reproduce**
Reproduction is fairly simple. Just add a `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` anywhere in your code, and when the script returns the  PDB interactive shell just press <kbd>backspace</kbd>.

**Expected behavior**
Backspace (or whatever key you pressed) will return `~[[A`, etc.

**Operating System**
 - OS: Ubuntu 16.04
 - Browser: No browser.
 - Version: 0.10.12
