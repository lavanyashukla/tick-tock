[Q] How to use wandb Table withour artifacts?

LABEL:

BODY:
I am using wandb Table and put a lot of image (wandb Image) in the table. I didn't use any APIs of artifacts. But I found some artifacts files in my local cache folder and the Usage Dashboard of the official website. And all artifacts are ImageTable. Can I turn off the artifacts when I use wandb Image and Table?
