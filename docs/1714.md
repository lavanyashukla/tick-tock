TITLE:
Artifacts: Easy feature to capture all the code and certain extra files every time the model trains

LABEL:
feature_request,c:artifacts,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
This isn't really a bug I think but is there a way to save other files being called by `train.py` file? For example, I'd also like to track `model.py` or `dataset.py` whenever I run an experiment.
