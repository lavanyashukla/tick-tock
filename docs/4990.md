TITLE:
 [Q] wandb instance in spawned processes

LABEL:
c:console

STATE:
open

BODY:
wandb version: 0.13.9
python version: 3.7.15

Issue: 
I have to spawn new processes in order to achieve parallel training, however the wandb.run object will get lost in the spawned process. This means that logging in the child process will not be logged to wandb. I can try to resume the wandb within the child process, but it seems to overwrite the one in the parent process. 

Here is the minimum code to reproduce what I am trying to ask:

```
import wandb
from multiprocessing import get_context

run_id = 'abcdef'

def run_function():
    print(f"is wandb.run None? {wandb.run is None}")
    print("check_point B")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    wandb.init(id=run_id)
    print("check_point A")

    with get_context('spawn').Pool(processes=1) as pool:
        pool.apply(run_function)

    print("check_point C")
```
In the wandb logs tab, I will only see check point A and C, but not B, since wandb.run object is empty in the child process. 

If I add `wandb.init(id=run_id, reinit=True)`, then I will have check point B and C, but not A. When I check the local wandb folder, I can see, if I reinit the instance, there will actually be a new `run-{date}_{random_numer}-{run_id}` folder.

Any suggestion how I can make this work? Thank you in advance!
