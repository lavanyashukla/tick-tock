### Description

Running experiments on an cluster as usual but after a while I'm getting these error messages and the job halts indefinetly (most recently for 9 days until I killed it today).

```
wandb: Network error resolved after 0:00:13.526510, resuming normal operation.
wandb: Network error resolved after 0:00:16.572186, resuming normal operation.
wandb: Network error resolved after 0:00:11.679736, resuming normal operation.
```

It happened multiple times this month. The most recent job where it happened is `https://app.wandb.ai/rmst/fovrl/runs/200210_044930_1`.

Is there a way for me to prevent this from happening?
