TITLE:
[Feature]: Custom script support in run comparer

### Description

Currently, run comparer just plainly list attributes in config/summary etc from different runs, there's no way to make some change to the values, such as creating a new attribute calculated by `value_a - value_b`. If it supports simple custom scripts, it would significantly enhance its flexibility.

### Suggested Solution

Invoke a script function with an obligatory name, such as `transform`, which accepts runs and their attributes as input, and returns processed attributes need to be shown in run comparer as output.

For example:
```python
def transform(runs: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]:
    result = {}
    attr_1_base_value = runs["baseline"]["attr_1"]
    run_1_attr1_diff = runs["run_1"] - attr_1_base_value
    run_2_attr1_diff = runs["run_2"] - attr_1_base_value
    result["run_1"] = {"attr1_diff": run_1_attr1_diff}
    result["run_2"] = {"attr1_diff": run_2_attr1_diff}
    return result
```

After calling `transform` with input
```json
{
    "baseline": {"attr_1": 1.0},
    "run_1": {"attr_1": 2.0},
    "run_2": {"attr_1": 3.0}
}
```
the result will be
```json
{
    "run_1": {"attr1_diff": 1.0},
    "run_2": {"attr1_diff": 2.0}
}
```

which will then be shown in the run comparer:

|| run_1 | run_2 |
|-|-------|-------|
|attr1_diff|1.0|2.0|
