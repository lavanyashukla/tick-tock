### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

I used wand.log({"my_loss": loss, "epoch": epoch}) to log the training curves. The run successfully run till the end (200 epochs) and from the local wandb file `wandb/run-<date>-<run_id>/files/wandb-summary`, it successfully logs the values until the final epoch. However, on the wandb server, it stops at the 115th epoch (I tried many times and the number it stops is unpredicable).

Is there any way that I can retrieve those missing values? or maybe are they supposed to be stored somewhere in my local machine? under `wandb/run-<date>-<run_id>`

I am using wandb 0.12.11
