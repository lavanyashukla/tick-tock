[Q] How to associate run with already uploaded dataset?

Hi, 

I'd like to associate a new run with a dataset that's already been uploaded. 

When initializing a run and adding my dataset artifact, it takes quite a long time since its ~50 GB. Also, my dataset hasn't changed from the one on your servers. Is there a way to point a run to that dataset (and its version), so that this association is displayed on the graph view?
