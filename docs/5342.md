[Q] SageMaker InternalServerError

Hi, I'm attempting to test wandb by running a SageMaker training job while using [MMDetection's](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) [`WandbVisBackend`](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine/blob/main/mmengine/visualization/vis_backend.py#L329).  When I enable this, before training fully starts, my training job crashes with the error:
> InternalServerError: We encountered an internal error. Please try again.

Do you happen to have any guesses on why this might be the case, or how to debug/fix it?
