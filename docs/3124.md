TITLE:
[Q] How to Organize simulations keeping them apart on the chart

Hi,
Inside my projected to organize my simulations I divided them according to their` job type`; for example one of the `job type ` is "evaluation", where I perform small simulation to find the optimal hyper-parameters.
Into this `job type ` I have one simulation for each combination of hyper-parameters' values.
 I'd like to visualize charts with each curve associated to an individual combinations of values (not ` job type`'s grouping ); if I remove from the grouping option ` job type` I'll automatically loose also the structure on the simulations' list, getting a messy list of simulations' names. 
How can I disentangle the chart's grouping keeping a well structured list of simulations?
