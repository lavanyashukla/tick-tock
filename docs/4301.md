[Q] wandb.watch() have large gradients while using gradient_clip

Hi, 

I'm using `PyTorch lightning` and  set `gradient_clip_val` to `1.0`. However, the gradient from `wandb.watch()` are really big.

Is it reasonable to have such large gradients?

The max/min gradients are over 10000 in the last few epochs.
