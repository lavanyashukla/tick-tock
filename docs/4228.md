TITLE:
[Q] Visualizing hyperparamter tuning with existing custom runs

LABEL:

BODY:
Hi, is there a way to visualize hyper parameter tuning plots such as the parallel coordinated plots (and all the other stuff which can be obtained from the wandb sweep agent) by something like adding my own custom runs which I can control easily from my CLI and visualizing them, rather than having wandb run jobs on my local system which is quite cumbersome I think.
Please let me know if anything is unclear in my question.
