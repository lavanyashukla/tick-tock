### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
I have a Pytorch-Lightning-Project where I use [hydra](https://hydra.cc) for configuration. A simplified code example follows below:

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
import pytorch_lightning as pl
from pytorch_lightning.loggers import WandbLogger
import wandb
import hydra

@hydra.main(config_name="config", config_path=".")
def train(cfg : DictConfig) -> None:
    logger = WandbLogger(project='project')

    model = Model(cfg)
    data = DataModule(cfg)

    trainer = pl.Trainer(
        **cfg.trainer,
        logger=logger
    )

    try:
        trainer.fit(model, datamodule=data)
        trainer.test(datamodule=data)
        exit_code = 0
    except Exception as e:
        exit_code = -1
        raise e
    finally:
        wandb.finish(exit_code)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    train()
```
But since Pytorch-Lightning version 1.6.0 my code hangs, if I interrupt the training with a CTRL+C. I used the [hanging-threads](https://pypi.org/project/hanging-threads/2.0.3/) library to find out the hanging thread and the traceback reads:

        File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/wandb/sdk/wandb_manager.py", line 126, in <lambda>
                self._atexit_lambda = lambda: self._atexit_teardown()
        File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/wandb/sdk/wandb_manager.py", line 134, in _atexit_teardown
                self._teardown(exit_code)
        File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/wandb/sdk/wandb_manager.py", line 141, in _teardown
                result = self._service.join()
        File "/home/user/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/wandb/sdk/service/service.py", line 119, in join
                ret = self._internal_proc.wait()
        File "/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/subprocess.py", line 1019, in wait
                return self._wait(timeout=timeout)
        File "/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/subprocess.py", line 1653, in _wait
                (pid, sts) = self._try_wait(0)
        File "/opt/conda/lib/python3.7/subprocess.py", line 1611, in _try_wait
                (pid, sts) = os.waitpid(self.pid, wait_flags)
```
Then I modified the wandb-service code and added a timeout in L121 in [wandb/sdk/service/service.py](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/sdk/service/service.py#L121) and this solved the issue by killing the service-process. Since the service-process was added to the WandbLogger from PyTorch-Lightning in version 1.6.0 (see [here](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/docs/dev/wandb-service-user.md)) I suspect it to be the problem.
