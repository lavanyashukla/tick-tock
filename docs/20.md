Change logic that determines which files to sync

This logic determines which files are synced

```python
            if len(files) > 0:
                self._handler._patterns = ["*"+file for file in files]
            else:
                self._handler._patterns = ["*.h5", "*.hdf5", "*.json", "*.meta", "*checkpoint*"]
```

I propose:
- If user provides files (which can be globs), do what they say verbatim. The "*"+file logic above doesn't work with my gaze code (see #19), which passes in paths like "./run-170906-113928/epochs.csv"
- By default sync any new files in the directory tree rooted at cwd.
