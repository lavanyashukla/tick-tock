TITLE:
Suggesting keras callback to handle tf.Dataset

LABEL:

BODY:
I currently use a TF dataset. 
If I want to log gradients, I have to supply training data to the WandbCallback() in (x, y) tuples. I thus save (some) batches of my training set prior to the run as a numpy array to file, and load them "into" the callback.

As an easier solution, I suggest the callback to accept a tf.Dataset as input for training data.
