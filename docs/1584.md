TITLE:
`wandb sweep --update` does not behave as expected.

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
`wandb sweep --update` throws a usage error when all arguments are provided. 

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
```
‚ùØ wandb sweep --update refactor.yaml
Usage: wandb sweep [OPTIONS] CONFIG_YAML
Try 'wandb sweep --help' for help.

Error: Missing argument 'CONFIG_YAML'.
```

**Expected behavior**
The documentation for `wandb sweep --update` is pretty sparse, so I'm not exactly sure... I was actually running this to see what it would do. But it looks like I am feeding it all the required arguments, so I would expect it to do something besides throwing a usage message.

**Operating System**
 - OS: ubuntu 18.04
 - Version 0.10.11
