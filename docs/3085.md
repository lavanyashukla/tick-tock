[Q] Best way to log train-valid-test split when randomizing during experiments?

Hi, 

I have a dataset which I've uploaded as an artifact, but it doesn't have a fixed train/valid/test, as I want to randomize the data in each split to get more experiment variety. Is there a way to easily log which files are in each split for a particular run? It would also be nice if it's easy to see in the UI. This would greatly help in experiment reproducibility.
