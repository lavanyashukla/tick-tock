TITLE:
[Feature]: Add kwarg `vega_spec_json` to  `wandb.plot_table`

LABEL:
feature_request,c:custom-charts

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

`wandb.plot_table` currently takes a `vega_spec_name` argument which must be the name of a plot specification stored in a wandb project.

https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/f87c083091ff1d70303536deb8213540038dcc86/wandb/sdk/wandb_run.py#L1891-L1895

It would be great to have the plot specification alongside the code. For 3 reasons:
1. to have it under version control
2. to have the spec move with the plot data (currently when migrating the code to a new project that doesn't define the same Vega spec, the plot will be broken:

3. to allow easier renaming of variables in the code while still matching the spec. Currently I have to remember to login to wandb web UI and update the Vega spec there to match code changes. This is error prone.

### Suggested Solution

Would be great if this worked:

```py
scatter_plot_vega_spec = 
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v4.json",
  "description": "Scatter plot with parity line (x=y)",
  "data": {
    "name": "wandb"
  },
  "transform": [],
  "title": {
    "text": "${string:title}",
    "fontWeight": "bold",
    "dy": 25
  },
  "layer": [
    {
      "mark": {
        "type": "circle",
        "tooltip": true
      },
      "selection": {
        "grid1": {
          "type": "interval",
          "bind": "scales"
        }
      },
      "encoding": {
        "x": {
          "field": "${field:x}",
          "type": "quantitative",
           "format": ".3",
          "title": "${string:x_label}"
        },
        "y": {
          "field": "${field:y}",
          "type": "quantitative",
          "format": ".3"
        },
        "color": {
          "type": "nominal",
          "field": "name",
          "scale": {
            "range": {
              "field": "color"
            }
          },
          "legend": false
        }
      }
    # ...
    }
  ]
}


wandb.plot_table(
    data_table=table,
    fields=fields,
    string_fields=kwargs,
    vega_spec_json=scatter_plot_vega_spec
)
```

### Alternatives

Maybe it would make sense to accept an `"id"` key in the `vega_spec_json` dict to uniquely idenify this spec so that previous runs that logged a plot with the same `"id"` in the `vega_spec_json` will update their plots to use the latest spec. That way you keep the ability to update all plots in a project using a certain spec at once.
