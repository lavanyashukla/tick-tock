TITLE:
Step deleted in patched tensorboard log

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
When a summary is added through the patched tensorboard summary writer, the step is always removed before calling `wandb.log`. This results in the following warning:
```
wandb: WARNING wandb.log called without a step keyword argument.  Pass the same step that tensorboard is using to avoid data loss see:
wandb: WARNING https://docs.wandb.com/docs/integrations/tensorboard.html#custom-metrics
```
The warning only gets printed once, so I originally thought the warning was only due to logging the graph without a step, see #571, but in fact the step passed to `tf_writer.add_summary()` is always ignored.

I tracked down the problem to the following lines:
https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/b90c8a8e4ee7d10d0f0bafdcac2221d70236b8fc/wandb/tensorboard/__init__.py#L162-L163

Why is it like this? I don't really mind that wandb does its own step counting, but it's a bit confusing and the warning is downright misleading if this is the intended behaviour.
