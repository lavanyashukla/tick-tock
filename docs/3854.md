[App]: Can't see logged images in charts UI

### Current Behavior

I am using wandb to report my generative model's progress. With a fixed intervals of steps (let's say for every 100 epoch), I want to log a set of sampled images. However, when I run the code below for this, generated images are saved as a file in the wandb web app instead of showing up as a part of UI. How can I fix this?

I also tried to submit images by giving each a different label and giving them as an array but both versions doesn't solve the issue.

`wandb.log({f"examples_{i}": wandb.Image(image) for i, image in enumerate(images)}, step=self.step + self.resume_step)
                    wandb.log({"examples": [wandb.Image(image) for i, image in enumerate(images)]}, step=self.step + self.resume_step)`

### Expected Behavior

I am expecting to see results in UI as I can see on the tutorials.
