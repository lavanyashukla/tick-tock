### Description
Default debug.log path might have permission problems on servers.
If two different users are using wandb on the same server, the default log location might collide and produce a permission problem which requires the first user or admin to resolve this.

### What I Did
```
wandb login XXX

wandb: ERROR Failed to set up logging: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/tmp/wandb-debug.log'
```

I think this can easily be avoided if default debug.log path includes a timestamp
https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/__init__.py#L66

For example
```
cur_time = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
GLOBAL_LOG_FNAME = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), f"wandb-debug-{cur_time}.log")
```

Could submit a PR if needed.
