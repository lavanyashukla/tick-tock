Running W&B Locally on an EC2 Instance (trying to bind to a different address)

Hello,
### Description
I would like to run `wandb local` on an EC2 instance, but I would like to have access to the reports from different machines, i.e. viewing the app not through `localhost`.

Is it possible to bind the `wandb` app to a different address (e.g. http://0.0.0.0) so that the page could be viewed form different machines ?

* Operating System: Linux-Ubuntu (on an EC2 instance) 

Thank you for your help.
