TITLE:
CLI: Offline sync of large files prints lots of terminal noise

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I am running my code on a remote cluster that does not have internet access while executing the code. Hence, I have to `scp` the files to my local system and then sync them. The issue with this is that whenever I try to sync large files(>400MB), a huge string of the metrics logged in at each time step gets printed out on the terminal. Would it be possible to suppress that?

My wandb version 0.10.11
