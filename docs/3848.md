TITLE:
[Q] Difference between `wandb.require('service')` and `wandb.require(experiment='service')`

BODY:
In [document about wandb service](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/docs/dev/wandb-service-user.md), it says for `spawn` multiprocessing, we should use `wandb.require('service')` in the main process. But in "General usage" section, it is `wandb.require(experiment='service')`. I also found that `wandb.require` has two arguments, 'requirement' and 'experiment' . What's the difference between them?
