TITLE:
[CLI]: Opening runs leaks file pointers and semaphores

### Describe the bug

Reopening #1447 which was closed in a broad issue cleanup. 

Initializing wandb runs appears to leak file pointers, as after opening a few runs, the process crashes with "too many open files." Quitting the process with Control-C leads to the common leaked semaphore message (and thus may be unrelated?) 

My use case: I intend to sequentially launch a group of runs for K-folds cross-validation. Each group must be launched from the same Python file because that file is my sweeps entry point. However, I can't get through all the folds I need without crashing on "too many open files." 

I'm on `wandb=0.12.21`, Python 3.9.13, MacOS Big Sur 11.6. 

Code to reproduce:
```python
import wandb
for i in range(100):
    with wandb.init(entity='exr0nprojects', project='snap', group='useless'):
        print(f"run number {i}")
```

The "leaked semaphores" appears during the first run, but this may be happening because I've been testing in the same shell. The full error:
```shell
/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.13_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/multiprocessing/resource_tracker.py:216: UserWarning: resource_tracker: There appear to be 54 leaked semaphore objects to clean up at shutdown
  warnings.warn('resource_tracker: There appear to be %d '
```

I got the "too many open files" error after the 18th run. The error message is quite long, but appears to just repeat the following segment:

```shell
