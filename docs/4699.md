TITLE:
[Feature]: Can the y-axis of the gradients in the web UI be automatically scaled based on recent magnitudes?

### Description

At the early stage of training, the gradients of a model are unstable and the magnitudes of the gradients can be very large.
Once training becomes stable, the magnitudes of the gradients are much smaller and do not fluctuate much. However, I notice that the web UI is using the all time minimum and maximum in the y-axis of the gradients. This makes it look like the model has a vanishing gradient problem but in reality it may not. It would be more reasonable to scale the y-axis based on recent magnitudes.

### Suggested Solution

Please scale the y-axis of the gradients automatically (or add an option to scale) in the web UI based on recent magnitudes instead of all time minimum and maximum.
