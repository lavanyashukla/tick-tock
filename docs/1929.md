**Describe the bug**
Hi, I'm trying to resume a sweep  run with resume = "PreviousRun.id" but the `wandb.config` I read after `wandb.init` are not always the interrupted run parameters 

**To Reproduce**
- create sweep
- start an agent (write `run.id` to file)
- read `wandb.cofig` (save wandb.config)
- start another agent(write `run.id` to file)
- stop first agent
- new run(wandb.init) with resume= `run.id`
- compare `wandb.cofig` to saved config. 
- see diff...

**Expected behavior**
`wandb.config` is  the same at first agent run and resumed run.

**Screenshots**
None

**Operating System**
 - OS: macOS Catelina
 - Browser: Chrome
 - Version: 88.0.4

**Additional context**
None.

Thanks!
