TITLE:
Error when debugging in Visual Studio Code

LABEL:
bug

STATE:

BODY:
I've been using W&B v0.6.34 successfully for a few months, and I could debug within Visual Studio Code, but I'd get a warning that W&B wouldn't log anything because it hadn't been executed via this:

`wandb run python <script>`

Warning given was:

> wandb: ERROR: Headless mode isn't supported on Windows. If you want to use W&B, please use "wandb run ..."; running normally.

That was fine, as I didn't want to log out when I was debugging anyway, but now after updating to v0.8 I get an error when I try to debug:

```
wandb: Tracking run with wandb version 0.8.19
wandb: ERROR W&B process (PID 3988) did not respond
wandb: ERROR W&B process failed to launch, see: C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\Temp\wandb-debug.log

  File "c:\Development\Coding\Test.py", line 778, in main
    wandb.init(project="tester")
  File "C:\Anaconda3\envs\pytorch-gpu\lib\site-packages\wandb\__init__.py", line 1067, in init
    _init_headless(run)
  File "C:\Anaconda3\envs\pytorch-gpu\lib\site-packages\wandb\__init__.py", line 296, in _init_headless
    "W&B process failed to launch, see: {}".format(path))
wandb.run_manager.LaunchError: W&B process failed to launch, see: wandb\debug.log
```

Am I right in thinking there was a recent change so that it doesn't need to be executed like this

`wandb run python <script>`

and would work by simply doing:

`python <script>`

?

If so, I suspect that's why it's failing as it can't successfully attach to the VSC debug process.  How do I get around this please?

Thank you.
