### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

When using the Python library to retrieve logged data, the data is **different** from the web UI's. Moreover, re-running data retrieval gives me **different** data, making me believe that the retrieved data is wrong.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
api = wandb.Api()
runs = api.runs("gau-nernst/heco", filters={"config.log_name": "baseline"})

runs[4].history()["loss"].head()
```

Re-running the above code several times

For some reasons, the values randomly become 0.85xxxx. This is a very serious bug.

### Additional Files

### Additional Context

My project is currently private. I'm not sure if Wandb employees can still access my project's data. If needed, I will make it public so that the bug can be re-produced.
