[CLI]: offline mode and upload wrong

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
Running in offline mode (and possibly relating to tensorboard). When I upload it seems to overwrite some runs with other runs meaning I have duplicate runs when I shouldn't. When I look at the log files they are correct but the logged metrics are not.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
wandb.init(config=defaults, sync_tensorboard=True, mode='offline')
```

```shell
wandb sync wandb results --sync-all --sync-tensorboard
```
