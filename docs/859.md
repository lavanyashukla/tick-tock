Resume with tensorboard

### Description

I have been using Weights and Biases to import the Tensorboard results while I train a model using the standard Tensorflow Object detection library. This has worked effectively for me my placing the `init` function at the top of the [model_main.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/model_main.py) file i.e.:

```
wandb.init(sync_tensorboard=True)
```

However, if I pause and resume training I am unable to get it to "resume" with Weights & Biases, either by passing `resume=True` or `resume="run_id"`, and I'll see results like the ones  shown below. Am I doing something wrong? Or is the resume function not supported for Tensorboard currently?
