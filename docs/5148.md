[Feature]: Wrap experiment names

### Description

Wandb does not seem to wrap experiment names which, when run names are long, makes it frustrating to determine which run is which. Here is an example where I have two runs with names: `my_great_fake_experiment_name_that_is_admittedly_very_long` and `my_great_fake_experiment_name_that_is_admittedly_very_long_v2`:

By manually editing the CSS a bit I can get this to look more reasonable:

In Tensorboard the default is to wrap names:

### Suggested Solution

Either make experiment name wrapping the default or add a workspace option to allow for name wrapping.

### Alternatives

I've thought about using external addons to customize the CSS for myself personally (e.g. [stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/)) but some of the problematic styles are at the lowest level (i.e. on the `<a>experiment_name</a>` link itself) which makes this challenging.
