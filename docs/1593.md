**Describe the bug**
Shutil same file error

**To Reproduce**
Log input audio at beginning of every epoch with 
```
wandb.log({"Input audio": [wandb.Audio(inputs[0].cpu().squeeze().numpy(), sample_rate=train_dataset.get_audio_rate())]})
```
**Expected behavior**
Logged without issues.

**Screenshots**

**Operating System**
 - OS: Ubuntu 20.04
 - Browser chrome
 - Wandb Version 0.10.11

**Additional context**
Audio is displayed properly on wandb. However, code crashes with this error after 2 epochs. Replicated multiple times on different machines. Handling the exception during the log does not seem to work for some reason.
