TITLE:
[Feature]: Improved documentation for WANDB_SWEEP_ID env variable

LABEL:
feature_request,c:sweeps,c:doc

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Description

Documentation for enviornment variables does not include information on `WANDB_SWEEP_ID.` This can lead to a problem when calling `wandb.init()` with `id`, `project`, or `entity` parameters if this enviornment variable has been set. This can result in crashes or unexpected behaviour, particularlly when trying to a resume a run that was part of a sweep but crashed/ failed prematurely. 

### Suggested Solution

Add information regarding `WANDB_SWEEP_ID` to the [online documentation](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/environment-variables) 

### Alternatives

Do not ignore `wandb.init()` parameters when script is executed directly by user rather than sweep agent initalized with `wandb agent`. Provide warnings to user if env variable is set and `wandb agent` is not used to start run. 

### Additional Context
