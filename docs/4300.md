TITLE:
[Feature]: Include additional system chart logging Network Traffic in terms of bytes/sec (not just bytes)

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

The current `System/Network Traffic (bytes)` chart is useful, but it is hard to grasp fluctuations in network traffic when plotting total bytes received. A chart that logs Network Traffic in terms of bytes/sec would be useful to help ensure that network traffic received is saturated.

My use case is training a recommender system model that is bottlenecked by Network IO. Being able to view network traffic in terms of bytes/sec would allow me to quickly see if my code is already pulling in data at the maximum possible rate (e.g. ~3Gb/s transferring data from GCS to a compute pod).

### Suggested Solution

An additional `System/Network Traffic Rate (bytes/sec)` chart plotting the rate that data is sent/received.
