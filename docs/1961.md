[Q] how to resume other data from the previous training?

Hi,  

I trained and saved a model under the directory "offline-run-20210316_100104-2ywaztas", I know the id is 2ywaztas.
The directory "offline-run-20210316_100104-2ywaztas" also includes other logs.

Now I want to resume the training process, so I used:
```
id="2ywaztas"
wandb.init(id=id, resume="allow")
weights = torch.load(os.path.join(wandb.run.dir, "model-latest.pth"))
```

Error happened in the last line:
`FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/folder/wandb/offline-run-20210316_111531-2ywaztas/files/model-latest.pth'
`

I think maybe it is related to the wandb.run.dir. It automatically creates a new folder `offline-run-20210316_111531-2ywaztas` rather than resuming `offline-run-20210316_100104-2ywaztas` .

My requirement is to recover all the data that is generated by the previous training,  such as the saved loss.

Could you help me?

By the way, when I call `wandb.log({'loss':loss})`, where do the log files store?

Thanks a lot.
