### Description

In logging images, I try to group them into certain groupings. However, it seems that the "grouping" attribute of the wandb.Image class is being ignored or I don't know the proper way to do it. I could not find any documentation which explains this.

I tried setting grouping to 
- an integer (how many to group),
- a list of integers with same size as number of images, each setting the group for one image

The wandb interface keeps on showing images in 8 columns with no grouping.
