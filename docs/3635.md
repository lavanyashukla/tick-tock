TITLE:
[Q] logging code run.log_code()

LABEL:

BODY:
Apart from saving the code from my main training file, say `main.py`, where `wandb.init()` is, I want to log other files that are used in `main.py`, e.g. `utils.py` that is located in the same folder, but I do not want to log all `py`files in the folder. 

Can I use `wandb.run.log_code()` for such a purpose?
