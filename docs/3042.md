## **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When using WandB with pytorch lightning, all logged metrics have an option to change the x axis to step, epoch ... etc. However, The logged images has by default `step` as the x-axis of the slider in the UI. This gives unnatural control over the slider of the images in the UI, in case images are not logged at every step. When specifying a particular invalid step in the slider ( a step where no image was logged), the shown image does not change and stays at the last step that was shown in the UI. 

Toy Example: 
In the following code, I am only logging images at every epoch, where each epoch consists of 2 steps. That means I am logging at even steps.

**The logged image on the last step (18)**

**When trying to see the logged image at step 5, where there is no logged image. the shown image does not change and the UI keeps showing the image at step 18**

## **Describe the solution you'd like**
**Solution 1 (preferred):** gives the ability to change the x-axis of the slider in the image, so that images can be aligned with epochs, in case the value of `epoch` is given.

**Solution 2:** When the user puts an invalid step size (i.e a step where no image is logged) in the slider, the slider should go to the nearest valid step (i.e nearest step where there is a logged image) rather than staying at the current step.
