TITLE:
Artifacts logged with the same name but of different type crash wandb server

LABEL:

BODY:
This has bit me several times. I have some generic artifact name, `foo-bert`, I've logged a `foo-bert` of type `tokenizer`. If I log a type `model` `foo-bert` the wandb server dies and my jupyter notebook is irrecoverable and must be restarted.
