```

in the middle of a run (after running for a couple of days), and the run shut down. I'm not logging to a networked drive or anything, as I saw was mentioned in a different issue.

I'm running with wandb version: '0.10.31'
and pytorch-lighting: git+https://github.com/wandb/pytorch-lightning.git@wandb-service-attach

I was logging a lot of data, is it possible I hit some sort of per-run data cap?
