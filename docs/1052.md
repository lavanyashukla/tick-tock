### Description

Sweep config file will format the hyperparams into the form of `--foo=bar` [doc here](https://docs.wandb.com/sweeps/configuration) and [code responsible](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/6a0b23dc3f07f61267757c3cc5d5d2100b14d3f5/wandb/wandb_agent.py#L306).

When using with Facebook's config library Hydra, this becomes an issue as no argparse is allowed, i.e. no `--foo=bar` ([see here](https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorial/simple_cli)). For instance, when wandb agent runs a command: `python train.py --lr=0.02` this breaks the code that uses it; instead it needs the command to be `python train.py lr=0.02`, then Hydra will pick it up.

Is it possible to allow for usage without the prefix `--`? This would enable very nice pairing with Hydra to manage complex configurations while still allowing sweep to work. Plus, Hydra is getting quite popular and is used with Ax and PyTorch Lightning.

Thanks.
