Getting url from run using python library.

**Problem or Use Case**
I would like to keep wandb silent, but print only the run/project URLs. I can get them for the log and print them but that doesnt seem like a very elegant solution.

**Suggested Solution**
 I would like to access these urls for my run using the python library. I took a look at the docs for environment variable and config and I could not find this. I'm pretty sure there is a way to do this but I can't find it. Thanks a lot in advance.
