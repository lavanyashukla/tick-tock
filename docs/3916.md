TITLE:
[FR]: Allow skipping new FLOP calculation

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

Since the recent W&B update that added FLOPs calculation, #3817, I now get: 

> WARNING Unable to compute FLOPs for this model.

Filling my output. I know that my model is designed in a nonstandard way, and this is likely to be the cause of the underlying exception that is being caught and thrown away.

### Suggested Solution

I ask that a boolean constructor argument `calc_flops` -- default True, to preserve existing behavior -- for WandbCallback() be added mainline s.t. `_check_can_compute_flops()` can be gently disabled rather than erroneously returning True initially and catching/logging tons of exceptions later.
