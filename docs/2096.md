TITLE:
[CLI] / [APP] First upload on an image with group fails

**Description**
I want to do a sanity check when I start a run. That is uploading some samples out of a training batch.
However these images will not be uploaded until the end of the entire training when I add a group to them (like 'sanity/sample_1').
If I don't add a group they get uploaded right away.
My training takes up to 12 hours which is to long for me to wait. Also I sometimes stop the training in between (using PyCharms "Stop" - not ctrl+c), in this case they won't be uploaded either.

Thank you very much for wandb ðŸ˜Š

**How to reproduce**
```
import torch
import wandb
import time

run = wandb.init(project='name', dir='~/test/')
run.name = time.strftime("%H-%M-%S - test")

rand = torch.rand((1, 28, 28))
img_2 = wandb.Image(rand, caption='foo')
wandb.log({'doh/doesnt_work' : img_2}, step=0)

rand = torch.rand((1, 28, 28))
img2 = wandb.Image(rand, caption='bar')
wandb.log({'works' : img2}, step=0)
wandb.log({})

print('upload started')
# simulate some work
for x in range(100000000):
    a = 0

    # simulate some more logging
    if x % 1000 == 0:
        wandb.log({})

print('finished')
```
