TITLE:
[Feature Request]: Allow multiple workspaces per user with stored layouts

### Description

Currently, there is one workspace per user for each project. Sometimes I require two (or more) different layouts with different plots, to examine different aspects of my runs. As far as I know, this can only be achieved by modifying the layout manually each time. A similar problem also exists on the Table page of a project, where one can require two (or more) different sets of columns, filters, etc. Again, as far as I know, this can only be achieved by modifying the columns, filters, etc manually each time. 

### Suggested Solution

A solution to this problem can be to allow multiple workspaces per user with stored layouts. For example, one can modify their workspace and save it with a name such as `My Workspace 1`, and restore this workspace whenever required. Each user can have multiple saved workspaces in a project. Similarly, one should also be able to save and restore the columns, filters etc. in Tables page.
