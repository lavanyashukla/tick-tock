Incremental sync

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Our computations are happening on a computer without internet access, so we need to use `wandb offline`. This computer shares a filesystem with another computer which as internet access, so our workaround for tracking experiments is to periodically run `wandb sync --sync-all` during the training. The problem with that workaround, is that every time a run is synced, ALL the history of the metrics is sent again. Suppose that the wandb run folder is 100MB in size, then every 10 min we have to send 100MB to the server.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
`wandb sync` should keep track of the last step it has synced, and only sync the metrics for the new steps. In short, it should do "incremental" syncing.

Thanks!
