Feature Importance not supported for certain Scikit-Learn model types

### Description

I tried to use `plot_feature_importances()` as described in https://docs.wandb.com/library/frameworks/scikit#feature-importances and found that it wouldn't work, the console logs show this message:
```
feature_importances_ attribute not in classifier. Cannot plot feature importances.
```

It's possible you are specifically looking for the attribute `feature_importances_` on the model but models like ElasticNet and ElasticNetCV have an attribute called `_coeff`, see docs https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet.html?highlight=elasticnetcv#sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet and https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNetCV.html?highlight=elasticnetcv#sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNetCV which essentially have the same information per variable/feature.

Would it be possible to enable the functionality for these class of models?

### What I Did

Checked the scikit-learn docs and W&B docs about this feature
