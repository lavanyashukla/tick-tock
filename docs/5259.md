[Q] Sweep working directory

Hello,
I'm trying to run a sweep on a script that is an subfolder: ```experiments/train.py```.
In the script I import code that is in the same subfolder ```from experiments.dataset import TrainTestSplit```. 
- When I run it simply using "python experiments/train.py" it works fine.
- When I run it through a wandb sweep ```wandb sweep sweep.yaml```  where ```sweep.yaml``` contains 
```program: experiments/train.py```, it says it cannot find the module experiments ``` (ModuleNotFoundError) No module named 'experiments'```. 
- If I add a ```os.getcwd()``` line in train.py, it gives me the root directory from which I run the command (when run using python or using sweep). 
- However if I now move the file experiments/train.py to the base directory ./train.py and run ```wandb sweep sweep.yaml``` where sweep.yaml contains ```program: ./train.py```, now it works.  

For now my solution is simply to always have the script in the directory from where I run the sweep command. 
However I still don't understand why I can't make the sweep point to a script that is in a subfolder of my current directory.
Could you help me understand this ?
