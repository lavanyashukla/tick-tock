TITLE:
[Q] Accessing table data from run(s) as a DataFrame

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I am logging tables to my runs, and can view them in the web app run summary page. I would like to access this through the api to do some custom visualisation. As far as I have figured out, the way to do this is to specify an artifact object and access the table via it's name i.e.:
`artifact = api.artifact('<project>/run-<run_id>-<artifact_name>:<version>')
artifact['data_table']`

(although this throws some errors as I've logged tensors apparently)

or to download the artifact and access it that way. 

Is there a way to get the concatenated/merged table data for all runs in a project (i.e. the same table I see from the project summary page) other than to iterate through the above process?
