TITLE:
[Feature] [App] Group by multiple params in charts

LABEL:

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When generating sweeps over multiple hyperparameters, I often want to group by multiple params in the charts in the app. For example, if I'm sweeping through learning rate, optimizer, and random seed, I often want to collapse across seed for error bars, but keep different learning_rate + optimizer combos as distinct lines.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd love the option to group by multiple features! 

**Additional context**
If any of the above is unclear, please let me know!
