TITLE:
Consider printing wandb log warnings/errors to console

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Currently they all go to wandb.log, it might also be nice to display them to the user (for example network errors). But probably we don't inject them into the user's saved training.log? We also may want to save wandb.log to wandb for each run.
