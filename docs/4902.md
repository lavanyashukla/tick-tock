For example, if I want to select 3 rows, is there a way to use SHIFT for selecting multiple runs together? Currently I have to click one by one for selection. This is even worse when I have more than 3 runs to select together.

### Suggested Solution

enable a shortcut for multi-selection (e.g. SHIFT + left click)
