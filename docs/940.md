### Description
My training scripts logs unicode characters to my log, different emojis.
When using weights and biases I get the following error:
requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://api.wandb.ai/files/irobot/project/16sno1k6/file_stream

After removing the unicode characters from my logging everything worked fine.

Just wanted to check whether unicode characters are supported in wandb
