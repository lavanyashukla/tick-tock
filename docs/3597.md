TITLE:
`_disable_stats` doesn't work. `wandb.init(settings=wandb.Settings(_disable_stats=True))` It still sends stats to WANDB, which in turn leads to BSOD due to incompatibility with the old PYNVML dependency in the vendor folder.

Can confirm that this is causing BSOD on Windows platform with Nvidia GPU with latest drivers. And since there's no way to disable it there's practically now way to use wandb on Windows
