### Description

I'm using PyTorch Lightning with WandB. PyTorch Lightning's training loop catches SIGINT (and others) and gracefully shuts off, allowing the script to continue its execution. This is quite useful b/c you can stop your training in the middle and still run the test loop and other tasks after. However, when I use WandB with PyTorch Lightning, it seems like WandB catches SIGINT correctly and passes it down to the script, thus stopping the execution of the script, but it also kills the script right there, so the test loop and other tasks do not get executed. Is there a workaround?
