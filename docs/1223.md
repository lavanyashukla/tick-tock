### Description

I use artifacts to track the checkpoint files (the artifact version is updated on every epoch) and for some other run-related info. When the number of epochs goes above 500, I run into troubles: 

on the "Output artifacts" page of the run web-interface, only the first 500 recordings are displayed, and I could not find the way to get the links to what was recorded after. 
Has the page lost the paging navigation? 

Here is an example run
