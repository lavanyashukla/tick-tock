TITLE:
[Q] Bar chart with multiple variables on same plot

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
The wandb dashboard automatically creates separate bar charts for each variable in an experiment I'm running. I want to create bar chart with 2 variables displayed on the same chart. 

Is there a way to do this without writing a custom vega specification? If not, I was reading online that I need to flatten the data first, is this the correct approach?
