[CLI] Breaking: `wandb.init()` crashes main Process w/ PyTorch TPU VMs on Google Cloud

### Describe the bug

When using the new TPU VM paradigm on Google Cloud with the default PyTorch VMs (in this case, the `tpu-vm-pt.11` image), W&B completely fails. Running `wandb.init()` results in a `Aborted (core dumped)`.

I was able to trace this back to the core TPU code in the library here and specifically this function [`is_tpu_available()`](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/sdk/internal/tpu.py#L86) which gets called by SystemStats.

The issue is that due to the build process for this image, the Tensorflow install is a bit weird, and rather than throwing an import error, the following occurs:

```
Python 3.8.10 (default, Mar 15 2022, 12:22:08)
[GCC 9.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import wandb
>>> import tensorflow
2022-05-22 04:26:37.222843: I tensorflow/core/tpu/tpu_api_dlsym_initializer.cc:116] Libtpu path is: libtpu.so
2022-05-22 04:26:37.385183: F ./tensorflow/core/tpu/tpu_executor_init_fns.inc:148] TpuCompiler_DefaultDeviceShapeRepresentation not available in this library.
Aborted (core dumped)
```

I was able to confirm that by turning off `SystemStats`, W&B works as normal:

```
wandb.init(project=<PROJECT>, entity=<ENTITY>, settings=wandb.Settings(_disable_stats=True)
```

As an initial patch, catching this error, or just straight up disabling SystemStats on PyTorch TPU VMs would be good; as a longer-term fix, figuring out how to add the TPU Profiler functionality for these environments would be ideal!
