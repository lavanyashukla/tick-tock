WARNING:root:Only 108 Image will be uploaded.

I am attempting to log images of kernel filters during training. My logging dictionary looks like this:

`log_dict = {'epoch': 0, 'U': [list of wandb.Image objects], 'V': [list of wandb.Image objects], 'W': [list of wandb.Image objects]}`

There are 256 images per variable. When I call `wandb.log(log_dict)`, I get the following error:

`WARNING:root:Only 108 Image will be uploaded.`
`WARNING:root:Only 108 Image will be uploaded.`
`WARNING:root:Only 108 Image will be uploaded.`

It appears to print one time for each variable. On the web app, there are indeed only 108 uploaded images per variable name.

I have reproduced this issues using different images, numbers of images, and numbers of variables. Any idea where the limit of 108 comes from? Any way to avoid this issue and upload everything I send?
