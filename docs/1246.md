### Description

I am trying to restore a previously trained model from a different run by specifying the `run_path`. But it still seems to be ignoring it and searching in the current run's folder.

### What I Did

```
> load_path = wandb.restore("best_model.th", run_path="rahular/nlp/o9yf2jxr")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/wjv316/anaconda3/envs/pos-bert/lib/python3.7/site-packages/wandb/sdk/wandb_run.py", line 855, in restore
    raise ValueError("File {} not found.".format(path))
ValueError: File wandb/run-20200918_164521-1n2653n1/files/best_model.th not found.
```
