**Description**
How can I get wandb to print/log the default backtrace on error, especially with context/line number for debugging?

I worked on integrating wandb into several existing codebases and the lack of default python stack traces on errors makes resolving issues more difficult. Wandb outputs by default only the Exception description str, not the line number or parent call, so it is really difficult to find the source of the problem.

How do/can I use wandb exit hooks to capture the Exception/Error on fail? If it is possible to get the Exception object it can be passed to standard lib traceback.format_exc to get the traceback message string.

#1654 #1971 have the same question but remain unresolved.


**Wandb features**
wand.init(), wand.log(), run.finish() with sweep.

**How to reproduce**
1. Produce any Error that would produce a backtrace inside a wandb run.
2. Check logs, stdout on terminal, it will be eaten.

**Environment**
- OS: Ubuntu 20.4, 18,4
- Environment: pipenv, pyenv
- Python Version: 3.6-3.9
