### Description
I export a number of figures at the end of training showing a variety of metrics by threshold, etc. I tried doing this with the standard logging syntax but I found that most plots that were complicated resulted in plotly UserWarnings indicating that it does not know how to handle them. Plotly version 3.6.1. I found this specifically with a precision and recall figure that contained two subplots, there were other errors but I didn't track them. Is there a way to handle this or would I need to convert my plotting to Plotly to avoid the conversion step?

I tried switching to exporting them as images but I found the space provided on the run page for media is too small to see each plot.
