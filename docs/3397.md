[CLI]: Tensorboard - PyTorch writer.add_scalars() not syncing

### Describe the bug

Tensorboard does not sync to wandb. 

Current code:
```python
	from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
	import wandb
	wandb.login(key="--------mykey--------")
	wandb.tensorboard.patch(root_logdir='exp')
	wandb.init(entity="wouter", project="errors")
	writer = SummaryWriter("exp")
	scalars = {
		'scalar_1': 1.0,
		'scalar_2': 2.0,
		'scalar_3': 3.0
	}
	writer.add_scalars('test', scalars, global_step=1)
	writer.close()
	wandb.finish()
```
Code copied directly from #493. 

**The current behaviour:** 
-writer.add_scalars/tensorboard does not sync to wandb **at all** (_no metrics logged yet_ in dashboard - no logfiles containing these scalars in "Files" in dashboard)
-scalars are alle present in local tensorboard session (so they are being saved) 

**Some additional things:** 
-In my other tests, wandb.watch seems to work/sync fine when training a model (all histograms are uploaded to dashboard)
-system data (ram/disk/internet usage) is uploaded to dashboard
-In my other tests, artifact.add_file works fine and all artifacts are uploaded


Am I missing something?
