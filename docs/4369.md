[CLI]: wandb logs scaled gradients when using automatic mixed precision (AMP)

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

When using automatic mixed precision (AMP), I explicitly call `unscale_(optimizer)` before gradient clipping.
However, it seems that wandb is logging the scaled gradients instead of unscaled ones.
The scaled gradient magnitudes make it difficult to check if vanishing or exploding gradients are happening.
A similar [issue](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning/issues/11407) was also reported previously with no conclusions.
Please kindly advise any workarounds.
