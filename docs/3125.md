Hello,

I used this example that was provided by WandB. However, in the web interface, it just shows a table instead of a figure.
```
data = [[i, random.random() + math.sin(i / 10)] for i in range(100)]
        table = wandb.Table(data=data, columns=["step", "height"])
        wandb.log({'line-plot1': wandb.plot.line(table, "step", "height")})
```

Also, I have the same problem with other kind of figure and charts that use a table.
