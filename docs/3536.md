### Current Behavior

When running more than 1 training with the same wandb.tensorboard.patch(root_logdir=logdir) having this error:
ValueError: Tensorboard already patched, remove `sync_tensorboard=True` from `wandb.init` or only call `wandb.tensorboard.patch` once.

Because the last wandb.tensorboard.patch() is still active 

 

### Expected Behavior

Being able to initializing again the wandb.tensorboard.patch (wandb.patched["tensorboard"]),
and being able to change the root_logdir of wandb.tensorboard.patch for each run.
