### Description

I want to do an analysis of data that was added to tables in my run summary. However, when I try to retrieve the data tables using the Python API, I get empty dictionaries.

### What I Did

```py
import wandb
api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("<project id here>")

assert 'table name' in run.summary.keys() # true

run.summary['table name'] # {}
```
