TITLE:
Remove slider from image widget

BODY:
Let's use react-slick to make the images scroll across all epochs and get rid of the slider.  As we scroll to a new epoch, let's display the epoch number as happens now.  On page load we should always start the scroll on the most recent epoch instead of epoch 0.
