### Description

For some of my runs, the artifacts page refuses to load. It hangs and eventually crashes with memory error e.g. 
https://app.wandb.ai/maria_korosteleva/Garments-Reconstruction/runs/veeany7a/artifacts?workspace=user-maria_korosteleva

There is also some Error in browser Console

There are runs, for which the page loads just fine: https://app.wandb.ai/maria_korosteleva/Garments-Reconstruction/runs/29iczuwn/artifacts?workspace=user-maria_korosteleva

### What I did

It started to happen with the runs when I started to upload an additional artifact with multiple versions. 
Previously, I had 3 artifacts created within a run, one of which added with many versions (checkpoints after every epoch), for the other two, only one new version is created per run => page loads fine
Now I have 4 artifacts, two of which are created with a number of versions => Page crashes
