Using sweep with TPU[Q]

BODY:
Thank  you for implementing a great tool.  I recently tried using sweep inside a Kaggle kernel and noticed that it takes a lot longer to run 1 epoch than normal model training. 

For example, when I train my model using TPU and Keras, one epoch normally takes 4 minutes.  When I run sweep, it takes 30 minutes. 

Is the sweep function compatible with TPU? Or, is there something else that I need to do on my end?
