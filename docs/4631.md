[Q] Default number of iterations for random search

Hello,

I am new to  wandb, so pardon if the question was asked before (I have checked previous issues but couldn't find any)

While defining the sweep configuration mentioned [here](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/define-sweep-configuration), wandb provides three options that is `grid`, `random`, `bayes` for hyperparamter optimization. 

For `method = random` as per my understanding, it takes a random combination of the parameters for each iteration. That is same mentioned in the [docs](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/define-sweep-configuration#configuration-keys)

random | Random search chooses a random set of values on each iteration.

But usually for random search, user has to give number of iterations ?, so what is default value that wandb uses for `random`. Also, how can a user give number of iterations in sweep configuration ?

Thanks.
