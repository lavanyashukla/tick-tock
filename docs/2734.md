TITLE:
[Feature] Add ability to delete or rename group for a given run

LABEL:

STATE:
open

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

I made some mistakes in the past by passing the wrong group to some runs. I'd like to be able to rename or even remove those groups from the runs.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Similarly to how tags can be added or removed, I'd like to be able to do the same with the group name.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

I could tag those runs with mistakes and group things differently, but it's annoying to change the settings just for that.

**Additional context**

In my case, I'd like to remove all these groups and only have the `<null>` one.
