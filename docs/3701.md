TITLE:
[Q]Why wandb.watch(model, log="all")  is not effective?

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
`wandb.watch (model, log="all")` does not display weights and parameters, but only a blank box, and the following errors will be caused during training:
* wandb: ERROR Summary data exceeds maximum size of 10.4MB. Dropping it.
* wandb: ERROR Dropped streaming file chunk (see wandb/debug-internal.log)
ERROR:root:dropped chunk 413 Client Error: Request Entity Too Large for url: 
* Exception: The wandb backend process has shutdown

During the training process, it seems that the program has been sending the parameters and gradient information of the model to **wandb**, which also leads to the increasing training time of each iteration
