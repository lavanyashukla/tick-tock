TITLE:
[CLI] AttributeError when logging retryable connection errors

LABEL:
cli

STATE:

**Description**
On connection errors I get the following stack trace:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/private/home/guw/.conda/envs/bt_dev/lib/python3.8/threading.py", line 932, in _bootstrap_inner
    self.run()

AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'content'   
```

Looking at the code it seems that  the error was just meant to be logged and retried, but here we get a crash instead.
The original error was just a `ConnectionResetError: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer  ` (wrapped several times).

I think this has been introduced in #1586 see my comment: https://github.com/wandb/client/pull/1586/files#r612291024

**Wandb features**
I'm using Wandb 0.10.25 with Fairseq and  `WANDB_START_METHOD="thread"`

**How to reproduce**
1. Not sure how to reproduce. Maybe it should be reproduce in a test case, by mocking the request library to raise an exception without response.

**Environment**
- OS: Linux
- Environment: Slurm Cluster 
- Python Version: 3.8.5
- Wandb: 0.10.25
- requests: 2.24.0
