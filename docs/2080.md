My log is not synced after 250k steps. When I sync the log manually, the following error occured.
```bash
wandb: ERROR Metric data exceeds maximum size of 4.1MB (4.2MB)

```
My model is rather large, when `wandb.watch(model)` is used, the metric file would exceeds 4m soon. How to change this limit?

I think there should be some notification of exceeding limits when logging. It is very wired that wandb.ai page does not update anymore while the experiment is still running.
