I posted this in the wandb forum, but also wanted to post it here to just in case it's more appropriate. If it's best to leave it in the forum, please let me know and I'll close this question.

Python 3.9.7
Wandb 0.13.4
Pytorch 1.12.0+cu116

I am running a neural network over complex valued data and getting the following error:
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):

RuntimeError: "min_all" not implemented for 'ComplexFloat'
```
Iâ€™m not quite sure what to make of it and was wondering if anyone could offer some advice? Thanks in advance for your help!
