TITLE:
[Q] Is there functionality to download artifacts only if they have not already been downloaded (especially for offline mode)?

BODY:
Hi! When using wandb artifacts, I run:
```
artifact = wandb.run.use_artifact("artifact1:latest")
artifact.download()
```
which downloads the artifact to `./artifacts/artifact1:v0`.

It appears that every time this script is rerun, it does some degree of redownloading (based on the printed text "wandb:   1 of 1 files downloaded. ").

Since I'm using artifacts to download datasets, it is a critical part of my program and I'd therefore like to be able to also run it in offline mode. Unfortunately, this results in the error "TypeError: Cannot use artifact when in offline mode." I understand that if the artifact has never been downloaded, then there's nothing we can do about that in offline mode and it should fail.

But, if the artifact has already been downloaded and we're in offline mode, would it instead be possible for wandb to return the path of the downloaded artifact? Are there any risks/reasons that discourage implementing this into the library?

Thanks!
