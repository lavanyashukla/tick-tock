TITLE:
[Feature] Tabs for filters, groupings, sortings in workspaces

LABEL:

BODY:
I find myself switching on and off filters a lot, to switch between different overviews of my runs. Similarly, I am often removing and retyping groupings, or switching between columns on which to sort. For example, I might be running an experiment with runs with a specific tag, that I want to group by some config keys, while at the same time I'm waiting on another experiment with a different tag, that I want to group by some other config keys.

The selection boxes for the filters make this relatively easy, though not ideal. The groupings and sortings in particular are a nuisance to have to keep doing and undoing. 

It would be awesome if I could easily switch between different sets of filters, groupings and sortings. I imagine the UI for this could be a tabs-like element or a dropdown element. Alternatively, having multiple workspaces for a single user could provide this, though I imagine loading a whole different workspace could be slow.

Alternatively, I could work with reports, but going into edit mode on reports is a lot of hassle, and the UI in reports is not as easy-to-use with graphs as the live dashboard is, in my opinion.
