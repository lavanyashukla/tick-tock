TITLE:
Entering a smoothing number without a leading zero doesn't work (e.g. ".5").

BODY:
When using the online dashboard, if you enter a smoothing number for a visualization using the text input field, it requires that you add a leading zero (e.g. "0.5"). It would be nice if it would allow floating point numbers that start with a decimal (e.g. ".5"). At first, I thought the text input field was broken and that you could only use the slider until I realized it required the leading zero.
