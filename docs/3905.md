Hi,

Thank you so much for constructing such an amazing repo! 

Currently, I encountered an issue that the line plots do not show correctly after I change the value for the X-axis. As is shown below, both `Metrics/EnvironmentSteps` and `Metrics/AverageReturn` are plotted correctly with the `x-axis = global_steps`

However, when I tried to create the plot with `x-axis = Metrics/EnvironmentSteps ` and `y-axis =  Metrics/AverageReturn`, the resulting plot is shown below

Can you help me with the issue?

Many thanks,
