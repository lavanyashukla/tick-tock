### Description

I am trying to filter my runs based on the number of steps (similar to the duration filter, but on steps instead of time), but this feature does not exist. It would be nice to be able to filter runs based on steps to see which runs have run long enough for certain metrics to be reliable or which runs haven't run long enough and need to be resumed.
