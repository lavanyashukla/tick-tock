TITLE:
[Feature] List uploaded artifacts (models) based on the metadata

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Like in e.g. MLFlow, it'd be cool if `wandb` allowed to list all the artifacts in the current project ("experiment") so as to download the best one based on e.g. the eval_accuracy stored as metadata of that run. This would imply a much cleaner and automated MVC (Model Version Control).

I think this could be a nice feature for `wandb` also to somehow "compete" against solutions like MLFlow, as this is one of the few things that I see missing to actually use `wandb` during the whole ML lifecycle.

Anyway, keep on the great work you're all doing! ðŸŽ‰
