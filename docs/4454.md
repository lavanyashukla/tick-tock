Hi! I am using W&B with Pytorch Lightning and I have an issue with .json files of W&B Artifacts being created multiple times at different locations for each run.

Skipping to the relevant parts in my pipeline, first, I specify the cache directory for W&B and initialize a WandbLogger:

```
os.environ['WANDB_CACHE_DIR'] = '<save dir>'
wandb_logger = WandbLogger(project='<project name>',
                                                   name='<expt name>',
                                                   save_dir='<save dir>',  # ***
                                                   log_model=True,
                                                   entity='<entity>',
                                                   group='<run group>')
```
I then pass this logger to a Trainer:

```
trainer = pl.Trainer(...
                              default_root_dir='<root dir>',
                              logger=wandb_logger,
                              ...)
```

which I then use for training: `trainer.fit(...)`.

During training, I create tables and lineplots from some run data, which I want to visualize:

```
wandb_table = wandb.Table(data=data, columns=[xlabel, ylabel])
wandb_lineplot = wandb.plot.line(wandb_table, xlabel, ylabel)
```
 which I then log using the WandbLogger passed to the Trainer during training:

```
self.logger.experiment.log(wandb_lineplot, step=self.global_step+1)
```

The issue is the following: .json files containing the data I pass to wandb.Table are created in two different locations: 1) they are saved to the path I provide to the save_dir argument of WandbLogger and 2) also saved in /tmp/ a second time, where other jsons are also created that seems to contain some metadata:

```
{
    "version": 1,
    "storagePolicy": "wandb-storage-policy-v1",
    "storagePolicyConfig": {
        "storageLayout": "V2"
    },
    "contents": {
        "valid_prc_table.table.json": {
            "digest": "<...>",  # I manually removed the values here
            "birthArtifactID": "<...>",  # I manually removed the values here
            "size": "<...>"  # I manually removed the values here
        }
    }
}
```

I would like to not have the Artifact data saved multiple times at separate locations, especially because the files created in /tmp/ are on a partition that don't have a lot of space, resulting in runs crashing. Manually removing the contents of /tmp/ is also not practical because there is a high turnover of runs.

Why are .json files also created in /tmp/ and how can I control this? Do I need to specify some additional arguments somewhere that stops Artifact data from being saved in /tmp/ and only saved to the run directory I pass to WandbLogger? Otherwise, can I control the location to where the /tmp/ copies are saved?
