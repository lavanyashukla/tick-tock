TITLE:
GraphQL-related server error when starting an agent for a sweep with prior runs

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**System:**

- OS: `Arch Linux x86_64`
- Kernel: `5.8.14-arch1-1`
- Python: `3.8.6`
- wandb: `0.10.4` for agent, multiple for prior runs.

**Description:**

When starting an agent from the CLI for a sweep with prior runs (created from the dashboard), a GraphQL error is raised. The error only seems to occur when these runs are standalone runs, _i.e._ not from another sweep.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Create a sweep in the `wandb` web UI
2. Select `Select prior runs`, and choose a single run that is not from a sweep. The runs I tried to select were logged using `wandb` CLI versions in the range `0.9.7 - 0.10.4`
3. Copy the command for starting an agent and run it in your terminal. The agent should error 3 times and terminate, each time producing a server error that seemed to stem from a GraphQL query.

Unfortunately, I have lost the stack trace from this bug as my 3 AM brain just wanted to get a sweep running, so please let me know if you manage to reproduce the issue.
