**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When creating a plot and using Runs-grouping by some parameter "A" (e.g., with the domain [1; 100]), there is no way to group the runs by some specific bin size into e.g., only 10 groups with the parameter A in [1..10], [11..20], .... ,[91, 100].

**Describe the solution you'd like**
An option to specify the bin size

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
An option to create a list of specific grouping ranges (i.e., instead of a fixed bin size, there would be an option to specify custom bin sizes).

**Additional context**
