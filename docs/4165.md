### Description

Hi,

Thank you for making such an amazing tool!  I'd love to use the scatterplot tool with a group-by functionality, where the dots are clearly colored by which group they are a part of (e.g. experiment1, experiment2...etc), where the x axis is some variable like resource_level or dataset (that could be categorical – doesn't need to be numerical) and y axis is some performance metric. Group-by with boxplots / max like you have it elsewhere would be really nice.  The problem I'm having is that scatterplots:
1. Only take continuous values for the x and y axis
2. You can't group by categorical variables like "exp=experiment1", so it's difficult for me to visualize.

I don't particularly want to learn vega, so I've been pulling the data from the API and using matplotlib.  It would be really nice if this could be in the webapp!
