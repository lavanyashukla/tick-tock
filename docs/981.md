[Question] How to enable a Feature importance table/graph in W&B Dashboard for custom models/algorithms

### Description

When using scikit-learn models with W&B, we can get access to the Feature Importance list as mentioned here https://docs.wandb.com/library/frameworks/scikit#feature-importances, how can I do that for native/custom runs i.e. CatBoost (on the back of the previous issue raised #965). 

Is it possible to send such a list via the `wandb.log()` command in a way that it receives the whole list each time and then when we compare or combine runs we can see which features have been more influential than the others?

Atm, I could send individual element of the FI list (variable and coefficient) but then the values are all scattered across the param list, it would be great to group these variables under one parameter and be able to track (and graph) the values in this list across different runs.

### What I Did

Checked the docs about FI for Scikitlearn https://docs.wandb.com/library/frameworks/scikit#feature-importances.
