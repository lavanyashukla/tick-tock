### Description

I was trying to unwatch models and rewatch them with new parameters.  I am using the huggingface library which uses wandb.  

### What I Did
 ```
wandb.unwatch()
self._setup_wandb()
 ```

self._setup_wandb() is defined basically as:
 ```

wandb.watch(
                    self.model, log=os.getenv("WANDB_WATCH", "gradients"), log_freq=max(100, self.args.logging_steps)
                )
 ```

Now, looking into unwatch/unhook in the wandb code:
 ```
  def unhook_all(self):
        for handle in self._hook_handles.values():
            handle.remove()
        self._hook_handles = []


    def unhook(self, name):
        handle = self._hook_handles.pop(name)
        handle.remove()

```
This is wrong, it seems that at some point self._hook_handles was changed to a dictionary, so unhook/unhook all should be something like:

 ```
  def unhook_all(self):
        for handle in self._hook_handles.values():
            handle.remove()
        self._hook_handles = {}


    def unhook(self, name):
        handle = self._hook_handles[name]
        handle.remove()

```

I havent tried this yet but I'll get back to it if I do.
