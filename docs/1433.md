Hi, 

I'm a big fan of your library! It would be even better if there was a way to completely bypass wandb when I'm debugging. More specifically, sometimes I'm trying stuff that **I know I will not want to upload later**. If there was a way to avoid the `wandb` overhead by essentially doing as if I had commented out all wandb lines, that would be great! Hope this makes sense. 

Thanks, 
Lucas
