[Q] How are logs captured by WandB?

LABEL:

BODY:
Lately I've been using an [unofficial WandB Julia wrapper](https://github.com/avik-pal/Wandb.jl) which works great, except it doesn't capture log messages.  I've spent some time looking through the WandB Python package and cannot see where it captures log messages, how are log messages captured?
