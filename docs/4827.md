Verbose output of directory creation?

BODY:
I've used W&B a lot without many issues, but something that has recently popped up is all of these verbose logging messages about attempting to create a directory:

```
attempting to make dir:  /home/djones/.config/wandb
attempting to make dir:  /home/djones/proj/.../wandb/
wandb: Currently logged in as: djones. Use `wandb login --relogin` to force relogin

```

This goes on and on, and it continues during my training processes.  I've tried os.environ['WANDB_SILENT'] = "true", but these messages remain. These messages do go away if I don't call wandb.init(). I'm wondering if I've accidentally enabled some sort of setting that is causing this. Any support on suppressing these messages would be very appreciated.
