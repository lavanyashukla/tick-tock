### Description

I'm attempting to run a sweep over hyperparameters but the jobs are launching as individual runs instead of as part of the sweep. Can you describe what conditions must hold for jobs to run as part of a sweep?
 
### What I Did

The approximate structure of my workflow is this: 

**train.py:**
* `sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep_config)`
* wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=train_sweep(hparams, run_config, hparams_file, sweep_config))```
where `train_sweep` is a function which calls a model definition in `model.py` as below.

**model.py**
```
class Model:
wandb.init(config=config_defaults)
config = wandb.config
update model params by referring to config.param for each param
model.train()
```

It seems that the init in model.py is starting up a new context instead of attaching to the sweep run even though it is started with the Wandb agent, how can I fix this? Is there some way for me to "pass" the correct W&B sweep context to the model class instantiation in the other file?

Also, is there a way to instantiate a sweep without manually defining the defaults? i.e. have just it pick one from the given sweep config.
