TITLE:
[Potential bug] Grouping changes x values in unexpected way

**Describe the bug**
**What I do is the following**: I train a model for 200 epochs and log several metrics (like train.accuracy, test.accuracy..) using wandb.log and everything works as expected. I do not pass a different step argument than the default. Then after training, I save the model and loop over a list of desired sparsities: self.desired_sparsities = [0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.95, 0.98]. For each of the sparsities, I jump back to the saved model checkpoint, remove as many parameters as desired (e.g. 0,3 = 30%), finetrain the pruned model (without logging anything to wandb). After finetuning it, I use wandb.log to log the current desired_sparsity and training metrics using a different name (e.g. finetune.train.accuracy, finetune.test.accuracy). Then I redo the same steps for the next sparsity in the list. Hence, the new metrics finetune.test.accuracy as well as desired_sparsity are associated with step =201, 202, 203, ... 

**What I want to achieve**: My goal is then to have a line plot in the webinterface which shows desired_sparsity on the x-axis and finetune.test.accuracy on the y axis. I simply add the plot via the Webinterface. This works just fine without grouping of runs, but as soon as I group them together to analyze different hyperparameters, I get weird behaviour: the x-values (i.e. desired_sparsity) seem to allow values greater than 1, even though I fixed the list of values above (see pictures below). I still can't explain why, but this might be because wandb also averages my x-axis (i.e. desired_sparsity).

**Expected behavior**
I expect to see a correct plot finetune.test.accuracy vs. desired_sparsity, even when I group the runs. When grouping, I'd expect to see some sort of average over the groups, even in this plot. With sparsities between 0 and 1 it is not possible to obtain values greater than 1. Grouping should yield a plot of average finetune.test.accuracy's for each step/desired_sparsity.

- The unexpected and **bad** result after grouping:

**Additional context**
I hope the above was not diffuse and it was understandable what my problem is, if not feel free to ask. This issue is related to the workaround I proposed here https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1557#issue-753345198.

Thanks!
