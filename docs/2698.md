TITLE:
[Feature] See final GPU usage average in summary

LABEL:
feature_request,c:system-metrics

STATE:
open

BODY:
I couldn't find a way to see a final global number representing the average GPU usage for the experiments, without having to include something like https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/generated/pytorch_lightning.callbacks.GPUStatsMonitor.html
