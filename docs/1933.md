TITLE:
[Feature] Web client: extend "What makes this run special?" to multiple runs, or simply a "notepad"

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I'm always frustrated when I'm constrained by the W&B web client to write a note for each specific run (i.e. the "What makes this run special?" editable text field). This is far too time-consuming if I want to keep a reminder for myself like "runs 1 to 11 were mainly for debugging purposes, before I had implemented XYZ technique" or "runs 55, 58, and 60 are particularly important because [insert reason here]".

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great to have some sort of notepad associated with the project (maybe as a new "tab" on the left-hand bar), where I can freely jot down information relating to the runs, without being constrained to the specific way the web client handles note-taking for runs.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I haven't really considered any alternatives; the notepad would probably be the best option, unless there was some other way (which might be harder or more involved to implement) to have a GUI keep track of notes on multiple runs (select multiple runs and parallelize reminders/notes about those?) or something more user-friendly.

**Additional context**
N/A
