TITLE:
[Feature] Sweeps not moved when runs are moved to another project

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

When I move all the runs of a project associated with a sweep to another project, the sweeps still stay in the original project with the count as 0.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

I would also like the sweeps to be moved to the other project, and linked with the corresponding runs in the project.

**Additional context**

Once such runs associated with sweeps are moved, the association of the sweep with the run (and vice versa) are lost.
