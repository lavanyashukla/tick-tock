TITLE:
[Feature] OR logic for Filters

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I find myself needing an OR operation between filters all the time. It's very hard to select runs otherwise.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In the filter screen, if I click checkmarks next to two filters, it does an AND operation between the filters. But for example, I want to find all runs that are "status=running" or "name=dog". This is excruciating to do right now in the current interface.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A simple line of logic to allow OR logic between filters.

**Additional context**

Add a UI element that enables OR operations here.
