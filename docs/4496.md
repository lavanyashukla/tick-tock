TITLE:
[App]: Config entries that are descriptive strings with whitespace do not show up as options for Group

### Current Behavior

This is a mix between a bug and a feature request issue.

**The Feature** 

Suppose I want to launch 5 runs and create a wandb plot where each line is labeled a certain way; essentially create a reasonable legend automatically that can be screenshotted quickly. So maybe I want to label my first config "Method A", my second config "Method B", my third config "Method A - variant 1", and so on.

This feels like an extreme common use case, so there may be existing ways to do this that I can't figure out.

**The Bug**

I tried to approximate this by utilizing the fact that the "Group" feature automatically labels runs by their groupby keys (e.g. if I put a set of runs on a plot and Group by "hparam", then the lines will show up as "hparam=0.1", "hparam=0.2", etc.). So I added a dummy key to my config called "train.desc", amended the configs with `config.train.desc="Method A"` and so on. I would then expect each run to be labeled with something like `train.desc="Method A"`.

For each run, this field does show up properly in the config (screenshot for example).

However, when I put the runs into a chart and try to Group by `train.desc`, this key does not show up at all. I can't figure out why - the only thing I can imagine is that it's explicitly removing keys that are string valued whitespace, although I don't know for what reason. Otherwise this seems like a bug.


### Expected Behavior

Grouping by any string-valued fields should be possible.
