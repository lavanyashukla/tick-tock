I think wandb needs a better way to use Tags.

The common use case could be this -- you have many bad runs, and a few good ones you want to compare against, so you want an easy way to label them/retrieve tagged runs.


1. Add ability to filter by Tag in the filter menu. Currently it's missing.

2. Add selector with popular tags at the top of runs overview. Clicking on a tag would work as a shortcut to filtering by that tag.
