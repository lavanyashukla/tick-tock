TITLE:
wrong run getting shown

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I just started a new run. The "logs" section is are correct, showing it on first epoch, but the graphs show 500 minutes worth of data, wondering where this metrics are coming from.

There's an earlier run with same name, but I didn't think this should matter
