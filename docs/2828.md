TITLE:
[Q] How to rename artifact version?

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I've currently kept each of my dataset versions on wandb, such that I have a sequence of versions: v0, v1, v2. I deleted v2 as I noticed there was a problem with it, and re-uploaded the dataset. The new dataset shows up as v3, so I now have: v0, v1, v3. How can I rename v3 to v2?
