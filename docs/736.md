Feature request: min/max values for logged metrics

Thank you for developing such a useful service. 

As a practitioner I care disproportionately about the _peak_ metrics in any given run. I.e. max mAP50 for object detection (and min classification/localization losses) or peak mIoU for segmentation. I rarely, if ever, care what the metrics are at the last step of the training run, per se. Things begin to overfit by then anyway.

W&B doesn't seem to offer a way to derive such min/max in the experiments table, or indeed anywhere its UI as far as I can tell. It'd be great (and probably not too complicated) to add this feature.

Thanks!
