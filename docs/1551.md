CLI: wandb.login() with custom host prints wrong link to wandb.ai/authorize 

LABEL:

**Describe the bug**
On running following, it prompts to get token from wandb.ai/authorize instead of wand.mydomain.com/authorize
`
wandb.login(host="https://wandb.mydomain.com", relogin=False)
`
In colab notebook I had to run following, and this worked as expected 
`
 !wandb login --host=https://wandb.mydomain.com
`

Here is the screenshot
