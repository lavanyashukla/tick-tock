### Description

As a user I can customize which columns are shown (and in which order) in the sweep view. 
But this configuration is not saved between individual sweeps. 
By now in my project there are hundreds of columns shown by default, from all previous runs, out of which I need maybe 10. I don't want to select these columns at every new sweep.
I don't know what an ideal solution is here, but the current one where the view config is per sweep is not good. For me personally (but of course there are others with other  needs) it would be sufficient if I change the view for all sweeps per project. And it would be even better if all sweeps and the normal run view share the layout (per project).
