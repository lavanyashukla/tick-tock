TITLE:
[Q] How to clear cache?

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I have run several experiments and logged the metric `A`, and then I delete the local cache files (./wandb) and the cloud runs. However, when I start the new experiments and log the new metric `B` instead of `A`, it seems that the history still exists. Two points evidence this:
1. The run name string is continued (not from xxx-xxx-**1** after I clear the local and online cache).
2. The `A` metric still exists in online view.

So I want to know how to clear cache and re-initialize the wandb correctly.
