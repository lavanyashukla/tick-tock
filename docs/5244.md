### Describe the bug

When I use Ctrl+C to terminate a process that has wandb running, I sometimes notice that a message remains in the shell stating: "wandb: / 0.124 MB of 0.124 MB uploaded (0.000 MB deduped)". This line of text persists and continues refreshing in the shell, which can be quite distracting. I am unable to clear this message from the shell.
