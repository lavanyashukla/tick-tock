TITLE:
[Q] Create scatter plot but delete/hide corresponding data table in UI

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
open

BODY:
I use `wandb.plot.scatter` to create scatter plots. The `Table` that needs to be provided for the scatter plot is also shown as an actual table in the UI. Is it possible to delete or hide these Tables by default (or at least move them to a separate panel)?
It makes the interface rather cluttered ...
