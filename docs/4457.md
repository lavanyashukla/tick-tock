[App]: Stuck at showing only 4 groups and new groups all have same colour

### Current Behavior

One of my projects only shows 4 groups in the plots and not more. It works ok in all my other projects. I've tried to reset the workspace, visualize and un-visualize. Nothing helped. Additionally, the newer runs all have the same colour. I only have 9 groups in the project.

### Expected Behavior

The max number of displayed groups is as selected in drop down and not stuck at 4. Additional runs get new colours.
