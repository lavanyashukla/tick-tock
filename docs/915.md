### Description

I am trying to run neural network training on computational cluster. Because of some limitation I can submit my job via srun, so it is not possible to pass in web token when wandb.init is executed. So wandb outputs me:

```
wandb: W&B is a tool that helps track and visualize machine learning experiments
wandb: No credentials found.  Run "wandb login" to visualize your metrics
wandb: Tracking run with wandb version 0.8.29
wandb: Run data is saved locally in wandb/run-20200315_130643-351p8022
```
But unfortunately after my model is created and starts training and error occurs:

```
Training...
Steps per epoch = 152
Total steps = 76000

Epoch 0
model.save_weights() at step 152

Epoch 1

### What I Did

I set `WANDB_DIR` to the directory I want and passed this environmental var. to srun. I have checked if python see it.

Any suggestion why this happen? 
Is there any way of passing web token inside the code or to env variable?
