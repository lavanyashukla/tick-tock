[Q] How to plot bar chart with multiple variables

BODY:
I want to add multiple variables to my bar chart. 

I'm currently using something like:
```
data = [(string1, int1), (string2, int2), ...]

table = wandb.Table(
    data=data,
    columns=[..., ...])

bar_plot = wandb.plot.bar(
    table,
    label=...,
    value=...,
    title=...)

wandb.log({title: bar_plot}, step=1)
```

Here's what it outputs:

Visually, in the graph I would like to have a second value at 2018, 2019, etc. 

I would appreciate it if I could get a working example of how to implement this (I've checked the docs, but didn't find a way to accomplish this). Thanks so much for reading! 

Note: I believe this is related to #2424, but it never got a concrete reply.
