TITLE:
[Feature] Including the autogenerated name for local checkpoints of our data.

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
When I run wandb I get a local checkpoint of the run data ins the `wandb` directory.
The checkpoint looks like: `wandb/run-20210404_003352-qwxqi48r`
At the same time my checkpoint is uploaded to wandb and has a automatically generated name, e.g. `mild-spaceship-1`
Is there a way to automatically rename the local checkpoint to `wandb/run-mild-spaceship-1-20210404_003352-qwxqi48r`
I have looked into the `Settings` class but it was not obvious to me if it can be done.
If there is no easy way to do this at the moment I would propose to make it a feature.
