TITLE:
AttributeError when trying to update a run using the public Run API

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
repro:
```
run = Run.create(run_id="foo")
run.tags = ["foobar"]
run.update()
```
The error is: `AttributeError: '<Run entity/project/run (running)>' object has no attribute 'display_name'`

It also seems like the specified run id is not used to name the run -- which might be related if it's something we need to replace with display_name.
