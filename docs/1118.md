AttributeError: 'FilePusher' object has no attribute 'rename_file'

### Description

I am using `pytorch_lightning` and am trying to upload my saved models as they are written to the logging directory. Everything works as intended except that the first saved checkpoint produces an error and is not saved. I am using `wandb.save()` to save the models when they are written instead of at the end of training. However, the error also occurs when creating `WandbLogger` and just setting `log_model=True`. The error appears to be because of `wandb` and not `pytorch_lightning`.

### What I Did

Logger setup:

```python
wandb_logger = WandbLogger(
    project="testing-project",
)
args.logger = wandb_logger
import wandb
args.weights_save_path = wandb_logger.experiment.dir
checkpoint_glob = os.path.join(wandb_logger.experiment.dir, "*.ckpt")
wandb.save(checkpoint_glob)
```

Creating a logger like the below also causes the problem:
```python
wandb_logger = WandbLogger(
    project="testing-project",
    log_model=True,
)
```

Error message:
```
