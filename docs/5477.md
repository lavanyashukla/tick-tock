TITLE:
[Q] Config library that supports "dotted" flags without creating duplicate config parameters?

Hi! I'm wondering if the nested-dict parameters from `wandb sweep` were developed with a particular config library in mind?

I thought [fancyflags](https://github.com/deepmind/fancyflags) would be a nice solution, as I can do:
```python
fancyflags.DEFINE_dict(
    'model',
    arch=ff.String('resnet_v1_18'),
    bn=ff.Boolean(True))
fancyflags.DEFINE_dict(
    'train',
    batch_size=ff.Integer(128),
    learning_rate=ff.Float(0.1),
    num_epochs=ff.Integer(50))

def main(_):
  wandb.init(..., config={'model': FLAGS.model, 'train': FLAGS.train})
```
and it creates flags like `--model.arch`, which I would like to have for manually calling my program at the command line.

Using fancyflags, I can define a sweep in YAML like:
```yaml
method: grid
parameters:
  model.bn:
    values: [true, false]
  train.learning_rate:
    values: [0.1, 0.01, 0.001]
```
*However*, I find that I get duplicate columns in the web interface, since `wandb.config` contains:
```python
{'train.learning_rate': 0.1,
 'train': {'learning_rate': 0.1, ...},
 ...}
```
One solution would be to manually flatten the dict from fancyflags myself, although that's not ideal.

I saw that `wandb sweep` supports nested parameters, and it tries to pass the nested parameters as a ~~JSON string~~ Python dict converted to a string, however this is not supported by fancyflags. Is there a config library that both:
1. gives user-friendly "dotted" flags like `--train.learning_rate` for running my code manually, and
2. supports the dict string produced by nested parameters in sweeps?

Thanks!
