TITLE:
[Q] Syncing multiple offline runs with common id as one run.

Hello,

wandb sync doesn't append runs (or combine runs) into one when common id is passed. 

The problem is that we are working on a cluster that gives us allocation for 3 hours per one job. When the job ends, I have to allocate a new instance and continue training. As a result of this, 4 different wandb offline runs were created.

Current structure:

~/only_chamfer_loss

only_chamfer_loss has 4 different folders:
offline-run-20220622_161211-only_chamfer_loss
offline-run-20220623_041049-only_chamfer_loss
offline-run-20220623_161607-only_chamfer_loss
offline-run-20220624_041559-only_chamfer_loss

I tried different settings, but all the time one offline run replaces another one. So, I see only epochs from 32-36, or from 20-32 etc.


What I tried:
wandb sync --include-synced --include-offline --sync-all wandb/*

I also tried to specify id and iterate over each folder:
 for dir in *; do wandb sync --id only_chamfer_loss --include-synced --include-offline --sync-all $dir; donels

the result is the same.

thanks.

I am using pytorch lightning and wandb:
```
logger = WandbLogger(save_dir=data["save_output_data"] + data["name"] + "/",
                      project="geomdeeplearning",
                      config=data,
                      offline=data["wandb_offline"],
                      id=data["name"],
                  )
```

If I set in wandb init resume='resume'

WARNING `resume` will be ignored since W&B syncing is set to `offline`.

I set 'offline' since the nodes on the cluster don't have internet connection.
