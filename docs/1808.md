TITLE:
[CLI] fastai WandbCallback triggers error when running on multi TPU cores

LABEL:
bug,cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
Using the fastai WandbCallback on multiple TPU cores triggers an error:
`AssertionError: can only test a child process`

**Wandb features**
fastai WandbCallback (`fastai.callback.wandb.WandbCallback`)  
The error is in the wandb interface call (`wandb/sdk/interface/interface.py`) which
calls  python's `multiprocessing.process.is_alive` method which triggers the assertion
error.

**How to reproduce**
1. [Link to a reproducible script we can run to see the bug](https://git.io/Jtggo)
2. Describe what we have to do in order to trigger the issue:
      **Run the notebook - it has a run on colab button**
3. Add a zip file with the run folder  - _sorry already deleted the run folder after closing the session_
4. Additional notes: 
       * added a [public wandb project for review](https://wandb.ai/butchland/multicore-tpu-error)
       * running with just a single TPU core is fine (`FLAGS['num_cores'] = 1`) --  [see this run ](https://wandb.ai/butchland/multicore-tpu-error/runs/puwm2xkd)
       * running on multiple cores (`FLAGS['num_cores'] = 8`) didn't even capture the logs -- [see this run](https://wandb.ai/butchland/multicore-tpu-error/runs/t45maezb) and triggered the following stack trace:
 ```

**Environment**
- OS: [Ubuntu Bionic ]
- Environment: [ Google Colab]
- Python Version: [3.6]

**Initial Analysis (speculation, maybe 100% off )**

Upon review of the source code where the error was triggered, it seems that the wandb interface code was calling python's `multiprocessing.process` `is_alive` method which in turn asserts that the `is_alive` method can only be tested in the parent process -- since running on multiple tpu core is spawning child processes -- my theory is that in these spawned processes the `self._parent_pid` (the main process) is no longer equal to the `os.getpid()` of the child process. 

My *meager understanding* of running on multiple tpu cores is that although multiple processes are spawned, one of them is designated as the master (ie. ordinal = 0) which is the only process where I attached the WandbCallback (all the other spawned processes don't have it attached), hoping to ensure that WandbCallback doesn't write its log multiple times... but then I encountered this error. 

I might review the Pytorch Lightning implementation to see how they did this, as this might also give a clue on how to fix this -- which I don't think is a coding error - it might be more of a design issue -- in which case
feel free to reach out to me to design a fix (maybe in my[ fastai_xla_extensions](https://github.com/butchland/fastai_xla_extensions) library). 

Best regards,
