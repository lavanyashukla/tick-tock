I want to show the each channel of first batch which is 5 channels
So I used Wandb.Image on each channels and wandb.log.
However, on the wandb.ai web, it only showed the last image as an image and for the other images such as
 real_img[0] ~ real_img[3] or sample[0] ~ sample[3] on the above example just showed up as graph.
 
did I do something wrong? or is it a bug?
