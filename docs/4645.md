TITLE:
[Feature]: Move single or selected multiple run to new or existing group

### Description

A run that is not in any group cannot be moved to a new or existing group. 

### Suggested Solution

I should be able to put or remove a run from a group I want. If necessary, I should be able to lock the group and prevent it from changing. For example, only the user who did the run should have the authority to move or break the new group. Since this is the only categorization feature under the project, this needs to be done quickly through the interface. Writing code for this is pure nonsense.
