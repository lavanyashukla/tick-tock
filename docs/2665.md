TITLE:
[Feature] Add distribution type of "range" for grid method

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Currently, if I want to try out 5 random seeds, then I have to specify in the config.yaml file like this (suppose I'm using grid search):

```yaml
method: grid

seed:
    values: [0,1,2,3,4]
```
However, the key `values` become useless when the number of trials is large. For example, if I want to try every integer random seed from 0 to 1000, it just doesn't make too much sense to write out all the candidates.

Is it possible to add something like
```yaml
seed:
    distribution: range
    min: 0
    max: 1000
    step: 1
```

I apologize if it's already been implemented but I missed it.
Thank you!
