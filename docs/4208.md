### Current Behavior

Hi, I'm using WandB as usual to log my program, I had to Run it on a Server which is not suitable for online logging. So I am Using `Offline` mode to handle the situation.
I'm using tags and I made a mistake. I passed the name of the run to tags and this time, the name was too long.
I have an Error, How to handle it, I really need this data.

```
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: invalid tag '20220826_011322_MobileNetV3_Attention_Pre_male_MSE_G32_M_Age_G0_Atten'. must be between 1 and 64 characters (<Response [400]>)
```


### Expected Behavior

Solution: Sync and if anything was wrong warn it but save the others.

### Steps To Reproduce

Use a Big Tag
