TITLE:
[Feature]: embedding projector - display image sprites similar to tensorboard

LABEL:
feature_request,app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Description

The embedding projector currently displays scatterplots, and if the data have an associated image, you can view them  by hovering over each data point, like the digits example here ([here](https://wandb.ai/timssweeney/toy_datasets/reports/Feature-Report-W-B-Embeddings-Projector--VmlldzoxMjg2MjY4#digits-dataset-(1797-records-x-64-dimensions---10-class-classification-w/-media))). 

But it's hard to understand the distributions because you (1) you can only view one image at a time, and (2) the rendering time is pretty slow. 

The request is to support plotting of image sprites directly on to the charts, which tensorboard does, like in section 4 [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_tutorial.html#adding-a-projector-to-tensorboard). This allows understanding the projection distribution much faster. 



### Suggested Solution

To match the tensorboard feature of displaying image sprites on the projection. 

### Alternatives

To use tensorboard instead of wandb, as in section 4 [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_tutorial.html#adding-a-projector-to-tensorboard). 

1. I've found this to be very buggy: following that tutorial, some data does appear on tensorboard, but not the projector data. 
2. I'd prefer to do everything from within Wandb, and not have to open a second dashboard.
