### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
Hi all! I have recently started using wandb and have encountered some strange behaviour when customizing steps. The code below that customizes steps for the "train/loss" key does not work, i.e. the custom step is not recognized, unlike the exact same code with the substitution of "foo/bar".  

1. Custom step for "train/loss" -> not showing the customized steps in the panel
<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
import wandb

wandb.init(project="my-awesome-project")
# Define the custom x axis metric
wandb.define_metric("custom_step")
# Define which metrics to plot against that x-axis
wandb.define_metric("train/loss", step_metric="custom_step")
# simulate training
for i in range(10):
    log_dict = {"foo/bar": 1 / (i + 1), "train/loss": 1 / (i + 1), "custom_step": i**2}
    wandb.log(log_dict)

wandb.finish()
```

2. Custom Step for "foo/bar" -> customization working
```python
import wandb

wandb.init(project="my-awesome-project")
# Define the custom x axis metric
wandb.define_metric("custom_step")
# Define which metrics to plot against that x-axis
wandb.define_metric("foo/bar", step_metric="custom_step")
# simulate training
for i in range(10):
    log_dict = {"foo/bar": 1 / (i + 1), "train/loss": 1 / (i + 1), "custom_step": i**2}
    wandb.log(log_dict)

wandb.finish()
```
I would assume that this behavior is not wanted, but it seems that the key "train/loss" is interpreted differently in the above code. When I replace "train/loss" with something unique such as "train/loss1" the customization works perfectly.
