[CLI]: Wandb client forgets access key

### Describe the bug

The wandb client library asks for credentials ever time a new process is started. It seems to not remember the access key any more. The credentials are stored correctly under .netrc file. This effect appeared only recently, I am not sure what exactly triggered it, before this worked fine. 

Downgrading the wandb version has no effect, I tried version 0.12.2, 0.12.1, 0.13.0
