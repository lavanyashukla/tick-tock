**Describe the bug**

I use pudb to debug my code. Currently, when I use wandb, it will affect the pudb UI.
Usually pudb should fill the whole terminal window, whereas now it becomes fixed sized and very small.


Also reported here: https://github.com/CompVis/taming-transformers/blob/master/main.py#L441

Any clue why that happens?
**To Reproduce**

**Expected behavior**
Using wandb should not affect pudb?
