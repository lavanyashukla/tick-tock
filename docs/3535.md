TITLE:
[App]: ROC plot run colour doesn't match selected colour

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

When plotting multiple runs on an ROC plot, the colours used on the plot don't match the colours selected in the web app.

The colours used appear to be shuffled (i.e. the colour used on the plot belongs to another visible run).

### Expected Behavior

The colour of lines on ROC plots should match the colours selected in the web app.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Plot multiple ROC's onto the same plot via `wandb.log({'my_roc' : wandb.plot.roc_curve(y_true, y_pred)})`
2. Change the colour of the plotted runs in the web app (might not be required to reproduce bug?)

### Screenshots

This is in a report.

This is in a workspace. The top curves should be yellow, and bottom curves should be black.
