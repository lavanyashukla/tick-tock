**Description**
According to https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/huggingface the best model from a training session should be uploaded as an artifact if the argument "load_best_model_at_end" in the Huggingface training arguments is set to true.  That is not the case, as after training a model with Huggingface and Wandb the model that is uploaded is the last model.

**Wandb features**

- Environment: Poetry Venv with transformer=4.12.5 and wandb=0.12.7
