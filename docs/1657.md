New table panel for constructing experiment comparisons

**Problem or Use Case**
I'd like to be able to compose flexible table comparisons of different runs for different model types and datasets, which could be exported to latex table.

I think this would make it much easier to analise benchamark results, conduct research and write papers.

Ideally, it would be great if I could easily create something like this with graphic interface:

(rows are models, columns are datasets)

**Suggested Solution**
I think this could be implemented as a new panel/chart.
So this means user should be able to:
- choose main metric diplayed in table 
- choose from which config field rows should be created (e.g. create new row for each model type, average results if some models had multiple runs)
- choose from which config field columns should be created (e.g. create new column for each dataset, leave cell empty if model wasn't benchamarked on certain dataset)
- export table to latex or csv
