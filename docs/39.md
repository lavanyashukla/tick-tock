TITLE:
ctrl-c "wandb run" can be confusing

LABEL:

BODY:
"wandb run" popens the user's training script. When you hit ctrl-c, both processes receive the SIGINT signal (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19807134/python-sub-process-ctrlc)

But if the child process doesn't want to die, like in our case where we have an exit hook that may continue trying to save files, things look strange. The parent process dies and the user gets access to their terminal, but the child process continues to run in the background, occasionally printing things.

A few options:
1) when parent receives ctrl-c, SIGINT the child twice. That should actually make it die though it's probably unexpected.
2) handle SIGINT in the child and die immediately. This sucks because we may be interfering with the user's script's signal handling
3) in our exit hook detect the cause of death and die faster in most cases (other than normal exit)
4) keep the parent alive on ctrl-c until the child dies.
and more!

At first glance a combo of 3 and 4 might be a good solution.
