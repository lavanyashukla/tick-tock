TITLE:
Feature request: parallel coordinates plot to allow dimension that's only defined for some of the runs 

LABEL:
enhancement

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Currently parallel coordinate plot doesn't let you pick config variables that are only defined for some runs. It may be useful to allow this -- just treat problem runs as having defined this config var with  some default value like "undef".

The use-case is following -- I add some modification to my training and add a new config variable to mark it, `stragegy: new_strategy`. Ideally I could've thought ahead and added "strategy: default" in the very beginning, but since I haven't, none of my previous runs have this config value. The absence of "strategy" config is enough information to be able to group runs based on "strategy" dimension
