### Description

Hi! ü§ó After testing a little bit `wandb`'s Public API with Python, I've found out that there are some things that could be potentially improved for `wandb.apis.public.File` (reference at https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/public-api/file).

- `wandb.apis.public.File` can either be a file or a directory, but when calling the `.download` method of a directory we receive an exception saying `"wandb.errors.CommError: Permission denied, ask the project owner to grant you access"`, which is not true, as that directory is both public and I'm the owner, it happens just because a directory cannot be downloaded, as we can clearly see at https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/a339333b3ee93864daf416f04c1501186dffac5c/wandb/util.py#L1128
- When calling the `.download` method over a `wandb.apis.public.File` which is a file and not a directory as mentioned above, we see that the `root` parameter of the method doesn't let you specify a complete path to a file in your local system, you can just specify a directory, which shouldn't be the case as you may want to download a file and store it with another name, as a single file without a directory, etc.
- And also, if a file already exists but you want to overwrite it, using the `replace=True` parameter in the `.download` method, it'll fail with an exception saying `"wandb.errors.CommError: [Errno 17] File exists: xxx.yaml"`, which should be handled if `replace=True`.

### Suggested Solution

In order to solve it, I can create a PR to handle the scenario where `wandb.apis.public.File` is a directory instead of a file so as not to even try to download it properly handling the exception, and whenever it comes to files just to update the `root` parameter description so as to allow specifying unique file names as directories cannot be downloaded, and fixing the `replace=True` behavior whenever the local path is a file path and not a directory.

### Alternatives

Another alternative could be to allow directory downloads whenever `wandb.apis.public.File` is a directory and not a file, listing the contents of the directory from the run you specified, but that may require another call, and then looping over those URLs either sequentially or concurrently to send the requests to write the files locally keeping the directory structure.

### Additional Context

This is an example on how to reproduce the issues mentioned above (we'll be using the following run files from `wandb` at https://wandb.ai/wandb/yolo-chess/runs/lig2ljt2/files):

- ‚ùå Download a `wandb.apis.public.File` which is indeed a directory fails due to permission error, when it's not the case, it's just because it's trying to download a remote directory and not a file.

```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()

entity, project, run_id = "wandb", "yolo-chess", "lig2ljt2"
filepath = "media" # media is a directory

file = api.run(f"{entity}/{project}/{run_id}").file(name=filepath)
file.download()
```

- ‚úÖ Download a `wandb.apis.public.File` with the default configuration works fine and creates the file with the same name remote and locally, but just when `root="."` which is its default value.

```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()

entity, project, run_id = "wandb", "yolo-chess", "lig2ljt2"
filepath = "config.yaml"

file = api.run(f"{entity}/{project}/{run_id}").file(name=filepath)
file.download()
```

- ‚ùå Download a `wandb.apis.public.File` changing the root path works but doesn't create a renamed file, but a directory named as the file you want to rename it too and then the originally named file inside.

```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()

entity, project, run_id = "wandb", "yolo-chess", "lig2ljt2"
filepath = "config.yaml"

file = api.run(f"{entity}/{project}/{run_id}").file(name=filepath)
file.download(root="./config_new.yaml")
```

- ‚ùå Download a `wandb.apis.public.File` changing the root path to a different file name that exists locally fails with an exception saying that the file already exists, even with `replace=True`.

```python
import wandb

api = wandb.Api()

entity, project, run_id = "wandb", "yolo-chess", "lig2ljt2"
filepath = "config.yaml"

file = api.run(f"{entity}/{project}/{run_id}").file(name=filepath)
file.download(root="./config_new.yaml", replace=True)
```

If you agree on improving this either with the solution I proposed or with a different one, feel free to ping me and I'll fill a PR if necessary so as to solve it.
