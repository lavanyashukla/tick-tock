TITLE:
[App]: regex does not match all metrics

LABEL:

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

At each iteration of my training routine, I am logging 30 metrics, all starting with the same name ("signal-0", "signal-1", ..., "signal-29"). I would like to create a *single lineplot* with the evolution of the 30 signals.

When using **regex** to select the metrics starting with "signal", **only 10 metrics are matched**, the others are not reported in the plot:

### Expected Behavior

The expected plot is the one obtained by manually selecting each signal in the "Y" box:

(however, I would like to avoid manual selection of the signals, and regex should match this plot)

### Steps To Reproduce

Reproducible Python example:

```
import wandb
wandb.init()
for step in range(10):
    for j in range(30):
        wandb.log({
            "step": step, 
            f"signal-{j}": j
        })
```
