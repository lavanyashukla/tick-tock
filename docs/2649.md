TITLE:
[Q] How to log a list of matplotlib axes so that I can use the "example index" slider

LABEL:

BODY:
I want to log a list of matplotlib axes via `.log()` call. The way I currently do is create a subplot of all axes and log the whole figure using
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 2, ...)
...
wandb.log({'samples': fig})
```
However, this doesn't treat individual axis as "one example" in the panel. I tried creating multiple plots
```python
fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots(1,1)
fig2, ax2 = plt.subplots(1,1)
...
wandb.log({'samples': [fig1, fig2]})
```
but ened up in an error saying
```bash
TypeError: Object of type Figure is not JSON serializable
```
What is the right way to do it ?
