[Feature] Please improve the UI of the dashboard for reviewing the gradients.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When I have multiple models with hundreds of gradients, I have to keep clicking next page to find the gradients of a particular layer of a particular model in the dashboard. This is not only time consuming, but also makes it difficult to estimate the magnitudes of the layers in the same model, since the gradients do not seem to be sorted.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A simple solution to implement would be to add a link for each layer in the model summary page so that we can at least review the gradients of different layers in new browser tabs.

A more preferable implementation would be having a summary for each component of a model in the form of line chart or other charts.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
