TITLE:
Feature request: Renaming project name, runs, and deleting them using code.

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Is it possible to rename project name, runs and also deleting them within our code itself instead of doing that using the UI?

I don't know if its possible right now but haven't found any documentation regarding that.

Thanks.
