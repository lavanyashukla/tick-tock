TITLE:
[App]: CSV export ignores np.datetime64 columns, although shown correctly in the web app

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

I have logged a 'date' column with datetimes in np.datetime64 dtype. They're shown fine in the UI, but clicking on "Export as CSV", these columns are just ignored.

Logging as str instead of np.datetime64 works.

### Expected Behavior

Expect to see also the date columns.
