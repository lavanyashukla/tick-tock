### Description

> The format of an authinfo file is based on the .netrc file specification.

It wound be much appreciated if wandb can save and read in .netrc.gpg .authinfo and .authinfo.gpg

Here are some introduction about authinfo: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusAuthinfo, https://github.com/sassoftware/pyviyatools/blob/master/loginviauthinfo.md, and https://github.com/aartamonau/authinfo

Here is an example to handle it https://github.com/sassoftware/python-esppy/blob/master/esppy/utils/authinfo.py.



### Suggested Solution

save authinfo in .netrc by default, but support to read it from https://github.com/sassoftware/python-esppy/blob/7a628659ae9559dcb148c9d693a60d88cae87614/esppy/utils/authinfo.py#L30-L39
