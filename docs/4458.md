TITLE:
[CLI]: `RunDisabled` object is not pickle loadable

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
The `RunDisabled` object cannot be dumped and then loaded via pickle. This is because it overrides `__getstate__` (https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/63941eaf98c6b34538a508cef108da5114ae10ce/wandb/sdk/lib/disabled.py#L174), but not `__setstate__`. The result of this is that if you disable wandb, but store something like `wandb.run.project` in a pickle file, the pickle file will save just fine, but then is not loadable. Unless there is some reason that `__setstate__` is not overridden, I'm guessing it is just an oversight?

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
In [1]: from wandb.sdk.lib.disabled import RunDisabled

In [2]: rd = RunDisabled()

In [3]: import pickle

In [4]: pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(rd))
```
