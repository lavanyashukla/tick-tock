[CLI]: Unkillable zombie python process on slurm

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

I am using slurm on a HPC to spawn a python process that trains a CNN (https://gitlab.com/casi-project/casi-3d/-/blob/master/src/shell_identifier_3_adaptive_lr.py). The wandb agent is initialised inside the python script. 

The code gets stuck after the first epoch and the slurm job exits with a timeout error.
Also, the python process doesn't get killed after the job ends. It also spawns another process ([wandb-service(2] <defunct> ) that becomes a zombie process.

The run currently shows a 'crashed' status on the wandb website.

### Additional Files

_No response_

### Environment

WandB version: 0.14.2

OS:

Python version:3.9.7

Versions of relevant libraries:
GCC 7.5.0
anaconda/3/2021.11
cuda/11.4
cudnn/8.2.4 
keras/2.6.0
keras-preprocessing/1.1.2
tensorflow/gpu-cuda-11.4/2.8.0
protobuf/3.20.1

### Additional Context

The original python code wihout wandb takes < 2 minutes to finish. 

For the python code with wandb, I tried stopping the run from the wandb web interface after ~ 11 minutes, since it was stuck on the first epoch. However, the run did not stop.
