[Feature] Heatmap with rich media on the x and y axes

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
In my current project I care about multi-modal learning utilizing, video, audio, images and text, and I want to be able to plot heatmaps that have rich media types on their ```x_labels, y_labels``` axes. I suspect that with models like CLIP around this will be something the community will be more interested in.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Enable rich media types like wandb.Audio, wandb.Video etc, to be used instead of text in the ```x_labels, y_labels``` lists. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Currently I put the data into a wandb.Table and then simply plot a heatmap that has the relevant IDs on the x and y axes. Works well enough to observe what my models are doing, but it's definitely quite inefficient in terms of time and attention required from an audience to understand. 

**Additional context**
This are some [visualized results](https://wandb.ai/evolvingfungus/TALI-visualizer/runs/mtyzqu1l?workspace=user-evolvingfungus) of what I am currently doing -- it's not pretty but it works.
