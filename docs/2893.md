I trying to log a dataframe, however I don't see the table inside UI charts
the dataframe value is 

[{"T0":"7979","T1":"7979","GT":"7979"},{"T0":"2894","T1":"3016","GT":"3016"},{"T0":"images/raw/a/20200621180317562533.jpg","T1":"images/raw/a/20200718210324019085.jpg","GT":"annotations/2021_08_04/20200516120303976612.jpg___fuse.png"},{"T0":"37","T1":"3","GT":"3"}]
