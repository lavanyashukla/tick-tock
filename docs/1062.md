TITLE:
When stopping or restarting a run with PyCharm, shell refuses to close

### Description

There's no real error, but it's an annoying issue I run into when I use wandb with PyCharm all the time. When I'm done with a run that I don't care about, or don't need the run synced (or I forget I'm using wandb with this issue and just restart anyway), if I click the restart or stop button for the Python shell in PyCharm I get this error:

`ConnectionResetError: [WinError 10054] An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host`
(full exception: https://pastebin.com/0weX5Lh7)

It wouldn't be a huge issue except when this occurs I cannot stop or restart the Python shell within PyCharm, it remains open in PyCharm, stuck like that. So when I want to start training, there's a Python process that's taking up system and GPU RAM because it refuses to shut down from PyCharm. I end up having to use Task Manager to shut down all the Python processes because 3 or 4 accumulate after a while, but PyCharm restarts Python processes stopped by Task Manager, so they all restart at once.

### What I Did

Use the stop or restart buttons in PyCharm to restart the current run without issuing a Keyboard Interrupt and waiting for it to sync.

### Ideal Behavior

What would be great is for wandb to ignore any errors about not syncing a run if the user shuts down the Python shell manually and to let the shell stop fully.
