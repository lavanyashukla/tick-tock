I am working on BERT-based models and it's nice to perform a bit of debugging to see how things are translated from a token prediction head. It is customary to create input rows with properly highlighted spans that show how [MASK] tokens are translated. It would be nice to highlight certain tokens in the translation and provide an immediate visual feedback whether the model is working or not.

For example:

```python
            for input_id, output_id, token_outputs_sentence, input_entity_ in zip(input_ids, output_ids, token_outputs):
                ground_sentence = self.tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(output_id)
                predicted_sentence = self.tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(token_outputs_sentence)

                masked_tokens = torch.nonzero(input_id == mask_token).squeeze()
                masked_tok_idx = 0

                expected_html = StringIO()
                predicted_html = StringIO()

                for idx, (ground_tok, predicted_tok) in enumerate(
                    zip(ground_sentence, predicted_sentence)
                ):
                    if masked_tokens.dim() > 0 and masked_tok_idx < len(masked_tokens) \
                        and idx == bool(masked_tokens[masked_tok_idx]):
                        masked_tok_idx += 1
                        if predicted_sentence[idx] != ground_sentence[idx]:
                            expected_html.write(f'<b style="text-color: red">{ground_tok}</b>')
                            predicted_html.write(f'<b style="text-color: red">{predicted_tok}</b>')
                        else:
                            self.correctly_predicted_labels += 1
                            expected_html.write(f'<b style="text-color: green">{ground_tok}</b>')
                            predicted_html.write(f'<b style="text-color: green">{predicted_tok}</b>')
                    else:
                        # We do not care about non-mask tokens. For what we know,
                        # the model may predict utter rubbish and we won't care except for the masked tokens
                        expected_html.write(ground_tok)
                        predicted_html.write(ground_tok)

                    expected_html.write(" ")
                    predicted_html.write(" ")

                expected_sentences.append(expected_html.getvalue())
                predicted_sentences.append(predicted_html.getvalue())
```

This snippet above converts a model output (already converted into lists of lists of tokens) into 2 arrays of HTML strings. For example, if my sentence is `["i", "went", "to", "the", "green", "##grocer", "to", "buy", "three", "[MASK], [MASK]"]` and if the expected output is - say - `apples`, then the I get the strings: `I went to the green ##grocer to buy three <b style='text-color=green'>appl</b><b style='text-color=green'>##es</b>`. `I went to the green ##grocer to buy three <b style='text-color=green'>appl</b><b style='text-color=green'>##es</b>`

If instead the model was wrong and predicted "cars" I would get `I went to the green ##grocer to buy three <b style='text-color=red'>appl</b><b style='text-color=red'>##es</b>`. `I went to the green ##grocer to buy three <b style='text-color=red'>car</b><b style='text-color=red'>s</b>`

My wish would be to make a Dataframe of those two arrays and log them into a wandb Table.

What I currently see is this:

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Allow for some opt-in kwarg parameter in wandb.Table to allow for markdown/HTML content. I do understand that allowing HTML user input is always a source of sanitization bugs and security exploits but it's definitely doable.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I considered using wandb.Html but it is not as powerful as a `wandb.Table` object.

Thank you.
