Hello and Happy New Year 2022! :tada: 
Just wondering if you already heard about quite the new **Pytorch Lightning (PL) ecosystem CI** where we would like to invite you to... You can check out our blog post about it: [Stay Ahead of Breaking Changes with the New Lightning Ecosystem CI](https://devblog.pytorchlightning.ai/stay-ahead-of-breaking-changes-with-the-new-lightning-ecosystem-ci-b7e1cf78a6c7) :zap: 
We already have joined integration between PL and your logger, so we would like to level it up. At this moment, we are running tests with your latest version, but it may accidentally happen that your next version will be incompatible with our next release version... :confused:  But here we have a solution - ecosystem CI with testing both - your and our latest development head we can find it very early and prevent releasing eventually bad version... :+1: 

**What is needed to do?**
- have some tests, including PL integration
- add config to ecosystem CI - https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/ecosystem-ci

**What will you get?**
- scheduled nightly testing configured development/stable heads
- slack notification if something went wrong
- testing also on multi-GPU machine
