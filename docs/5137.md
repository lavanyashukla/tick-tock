### Current Behavior

When I table view of my workspace, it says "There was a problem rendering these panels." Clicking on the subsequent button to reset my workspace does not solve the issue. I have already deleted all runs, but issue persists. Looking at the browser console I get "GraphQL error: internal database error"

[Here's the link](https://wandb.ai/timbmg/peer-qa-question-context-clf/table?workspace=user-timbmg-28) to the workspace.
