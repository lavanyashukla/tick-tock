TITLE:
[Feature]: Allow for python client to work with run groups

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

In the web client a user is able to add a `tag` for an existing run group. It would be nice for the python client to be able to query such groups. For example if a group represents a pipeline of runs (load -> process -> train -> evaluate) a user might want to tag such pipeline with `experiment` tag when the pipeline is finished. And later query all  groups (pipelines) with the `experiment` tag and do some analysis on the pipeline.

### Suggested Solution

Implement apis `wandb.apis.public.RunGroups` and `wandb.apis.public.RunGroup` so a user can query group of runs and work with them using: 
```
my_group =  api.run_group(path="my_entity/my_project/gropus/my_group")
my_group.tags.append("experiment")
my_group.update()
...
groups = api.run_groups(path="my_entity/my_project", filters={"tag": "experiment})
for group in groups:
    for run in group.runs(filters={"jobType": "train}):
        print(run.summary['accuarcy'])
        
```

### Alternatives

Expose direct GQL queries and mutations so we can do:

```
import wandb
from wandb.apis.public import gql

api = wandb.Api()

query = gql(
"""
query runGroup {
    id
    name
    notes
    tags {
        name
        colorIndex
    }
  }
"""
)

res = api.client.execute(query)
```

Or something similar
