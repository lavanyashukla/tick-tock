**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
At the moment I export svg and try to use other applications to convert it to pdf. But the svg file has some black parts.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great to be able to export a high-quality image of plots. At the moment, the report and png exports are not good enough to put it on paper.
