[CLI]: wandb hangs on wandb.init() when trying to start a run

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
When attempting to initialize a run, wandb hangs on wandb.init(). Leaving it for upwards of ten minutes, nothing happens. 
I have attempted to relogin, as well as creating a new api key and relogging in with that but nothing seems to fix it.
Note: I am the owner of the aicv-lab team and I own the wgan-gp project.
<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
CONFIG = dict(
    dataset = DATASET,
    subset = SUBSET,

    layers_crit = NUM_LAYERS_CRIT,
    kernels_crit = KERNEL_CRIT,
    stride_crit = STRIDE_CRIT,
    padding_crit = PAD_CRIT,
    features_crit = FEATURES_CRIT,

    layers_gen = NUM_LAYERS_GEN,
    kernels_gen = KERNEL_GEN,
    stride_gen = STRIDE_GEN,
    padding_gen = PAD_GEN,
    features_gen = FEATURES_GEN,

    batch_size = BATCH_SIZE,
    learning_rate_crit = LR_CRIT,
    learning_rate_gen = LR_GEN,
    crit_iterations = CRIT_ITERATIONS,
    gp_coefficient = LAMBDA
)

if RECORD_METRICS: # if false will not save checkpoint or log on W+B # gets stuck here
    run = wandb.init(project='wgan-gp', entity='aicv-lab', config=CONFIG)
```

When I check if I am logged in, I get this, so I am not sure why I can't initialize a run.
```
$ ~/Git/LSTM-Autoencoder$ wandb login
wandb: Currently logged in as: sploeger. Use `wandb login --relogin` to force relogin
```
