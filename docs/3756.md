TITLE:
[CLI]: ROC Curve clips remaining points

BODY:
### Describe the bug

`wandb.plot.roc_curve()` will clip the remaining points in an illogical way when the data exceeds `chart_limit = wandb.Table.MAX_ROWS`. This is problematic particularly because it forces the user to use less data for evaluation, as opposed to subsampling the true/false positive rates after computing them with all data.
