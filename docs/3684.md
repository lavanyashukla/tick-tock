TITLE:
[Feature]: String replace across entire run data

### Description

It's possible to rename individual fields like the name of a run via

```py
runs = api.runs(
    path="my_entity/my_project",
    filters={"display_name": {"$regex": "^foo.*"}}
)

for run in tqdm(runs):
    run.display_name = run.display_name.replace("foo", "bar")
    run.update()
```

This leaves other fields like `config.model` containing `foo` unchanged.

### Suggested Solution

Would be nice if there was a method to do string replacement across all data associated with a run.

Something like `JSON.stringify(all_run_data).replaceAll('old_str', 'new_str')`.
