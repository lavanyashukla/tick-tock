TITLE:
[Feature]: Add `image_layer` type to the `Image` class

### Description

In computer vision applications where you have spatially registered images taken of the same scene, it is often helpful to be able to visualize these as "Image Layers" on top of each other. One example is in hyperspectral imaging where the imaging system produces N channels of image (N being as much as >100). The ability to visualize these additional channels in the W&B UI will be helpful.


Example:

![Hyperspectral 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6583837/224731754-dedbb005-c51b-41d9-bcac-a4de598ad78d.png)

In this case, having a UI to toggle these individual channels on top of the main image (a) will be helpful.



### Suggested Solution

In the [Image class](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/data-types/image) add an optional argument:

`Image(
 data_or_path: "ImageDataOrPathType",
 mode: Optional[str] = None,
 caption: Optional[str] = None,
 grouping: Optional[int] = None,
 classes: Optional[Union['Classes', Sequence[dict]]] = None,
 boxes: Optional[Union[Dict[str, 'BoundingBoxes2D'], Dict[str, dict]]] = None,
 masks: Optional[Union[Dict[str, 'ImageMask'], Dict[str, dict]]] = None,
image_layers: Optional[Dict[str, "ImageDataOrPathType"]] = None
) -> None`

Where `image_layers` will contain additional images that are spatially registered to the main image.

The UI can be implemented in the view where you can currently toggle the segmentation masks. Something like an "Image Layer" dropdown could make sense.
