CLI Clarification: How wandb handles the queue, writing to disk, and network requests

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Logging can be expensive in read / write. Would like to be able to write to disk / send to network `every_n_steps`.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Tensorboard's `SummaryWriter` has a `max_queue` parameter that is `Size of the queue for pending events and summaries before one of the 'add' calls forces a flush to disk.`

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Thought that using `commit=False` in `Run.log` method could do the trick, but it's not suited since updating the `step` between this batch call of `log(..., commit=False)` with trigger
```
elif step > self.history._step:
                self.history._flush()
```
