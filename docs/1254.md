W&B data tranmission

### Description

Not so much a problem, but more of a question. I get the following warning message:

wandb: WARNING W&B installed but not logged in.  Run `wandb login` or set the WANDB_API_KEY env variable.

I wanted to make sure that although I'm not logged or set any project, that no data is actually transmitted to W&B. If I did specify an API key, would the only thing that are sent is hyperparatemeters and weights?
