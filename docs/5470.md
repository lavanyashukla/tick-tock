BODY:
I still don't understand much about networks and I have to fix a problem that came up with transferring files from one computer to another. I'm using the ftplib library and FileZilla to create a server on the computer that needs to receive the transfer. I'm attaching images of the text that shows up in my program. This is a recent issue; everything was working fine until the internet service provider was changed, and apparently there was an issue with the IPs.
It should be noted that the first and second image comes directly from the code, while the third and four is from a separate window that opened. "If you need more information, let me know because I still don't quite understand if it's a code or server issue.
