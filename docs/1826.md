TITLE:
Able to continue adding data in same Text Table [Feature] 

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
Consider, I have long running Program, which produce billions of logs every day, Its impossible to create table with all data  and feed it to wandb dashboard.

Currently , when I create and log text table in wandb using following methods , 
```
# Method 1
data = [["I love my phone", "1", "1"],["My phone sucks", "0", "-1"]]
wandb.log({"examples": wandb.Table(data=data, columns=["Text", "Predicted Label", "True Label"])})

# Method 2
table = wandb.Table(columns=["Text", "Predicted Label", "True Label"])
table.add_data("I love my phone", "1", "1")
table.add_data("My phone sucks", "0", "-1")
wandb.log({"examples": table})
```

**It will create New table every time I log, rather than continue adding data on already existed table.**

**If we have a functionality of adding data incrementally in already existed table, That would be really really helpful.**

Thanks
