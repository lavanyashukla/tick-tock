TITLE:
Add option for blocking wandb.save() call to immediately save

### Description

I am trying to save a file with `wandb.save(filename)`. I am deleting the file after calling `wandb.save()`. Unfortunately, this leads to wandb not saving the file, because it does lazy saving/uploading. I need to delete the file, so it's not an option to keep the file around. 

Thus it would be great if you add an option to call save that makes sure after returning the file is uploaded, or expose a `wandb.sync()` function that triggers a sync (push metrics to wandb, upload files, etc.) and returns when the sync is finished.
