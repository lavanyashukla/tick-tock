TITLE:
[Feature] Parallel sync

LABEL:

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I've recently had to do my uploads manually (incidentally left `wandb` in offline mode). In attempting to do `wandb sync --sync-all`, the client uploads each run sequentially. 

I'm curious if supporting parallel uploads (at least to network saturation) would be a useful feature to others.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Parallel uploads â€“ probably some set of options like `--nprocs` and `--saturate`. Maybe this makes sense even within a run, but I imagine that probably stresses the W&B side quite a bit.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Monkeypatching my install to support spinning up processes to handle uploads.

**Additional context**
N/A
