[Q] how to log matplotlib plot without having it shown up in the jupyter notebook?

Hi, I am trying to log dozens of matplotlib over course of training using `self.logger.experiment.log({'myFig': wandb.Image(fig)}, commit=False)`, where `fig` is a matplotlib.Figure object.  But when the training is done, all figures would automatically show up in the jupyter notebook as well, making the size of notebook unnecessarily large.  I am wondering if there is way to log all plots without having them shown up in jupyter notebook?

Thank you!
