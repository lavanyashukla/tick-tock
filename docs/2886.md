TITLE:
[Q] How do you save all codes in directory?

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
Currently, when saving code on wandb, it only saves train.py file.

I want to save all the files in working directory.

I have tried

code = wandb.Artifact(args.name, type="code")
                for path in glob.glob("**/*.py", recursive=True):
                    code.add_file(path)
                wandb.run.use_artifact(code)

but doesn't seem to work
