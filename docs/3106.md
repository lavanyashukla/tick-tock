TITLE:
[Feature] Media web view add next/previous image to large view

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I want to quickly skip through enlarged images in the Media view to debug outputs.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In the media view in a run, when you click on an image you get a larger version of the image. If I want to see the next image large I need to close and click on the next. I'd like to be able to click "next"/"previous" instead.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Alternatively you could provide an option to show the list of images bigger.
