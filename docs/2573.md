TITLE:
[Q]Network traffic in offline mode

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I run an experiment in offline mode, and then synchronized the wandb log after the experiment finished. However, I found that the network traffic was the same as in the online mode. So I would like to ask why the network traffic is so large even in offline mode, and how we can avoid it.
