TITLE:
[Feature]: Video logging with Gymnasium

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
### Description

[Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/) is a follow-up maintenance repository for the gym package.

> The team that has been maintaining Gym since 2021 has moved all future development to [Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium), a drop in replacement for Gym (import gymnasium as gym), and this repo isn't planned to receive any future updates. Please consider switching over to Gymnasium as you're able to do so.

Currently Wandb does not support video logging with Gymnasium. Gym0.26 needs to be supported in order to support Gymnasium. I see that there is a PR in progress to support Gym0.26. #4363 



### Suggested Solution

We may need to support both Gym and Gymnasium. After #4363  is completed,  it seems that both Gym and gyms can continue to use Wandb log video. Because Gymnasium temporarily depends on Gym0.26. 

We may need to support Gymnasium separately so that it can be updated later.
