TITLE:
[App] wandb.plot.bar no permission to view 

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
As of recently, none of the `wandb.plot.bar` plots are displaying in any of my projects

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
I tried a simple test such as this
`wandb.init(...)`
`testData = [[0,5], [1,10], [2,3], [3,20]]`
`testTable = wandb.Table(data=testData, columns=['index', 'block'])`
`wandb.log({'testTable': wandb.plot.bar(testTable, 'index', 'block', title='test')})`

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
A bar chart should appear. Instead, getting the message: "This chart does not exist or you don't have permission to view it."


**Screenshots**

I can manually edit the plot to make it a histogram, but this is not formatted as a bar chart
