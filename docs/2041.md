[Q] logged histogram on the dashboard page

Hi, 

I would like to show a histogram logged with `wandb.log(wandb.Histogram(mydata))` on the dashboard page so that I can compare it with other runs (the visualization I already get in each specific run page is correct with [x:iterations, y:bins]).

I spent some time trying without success, is there any way to achieve this?
