TITLE:
[Q] [special characters wrongly formatted in group name]

Hello,

Weirdly in one of my project (but not the other one), the group name does not handle special characters well. After clicking on it I get redirected to a wrongly formatted url which is saying `No metrics logged yet.`
For instance: `Group: test_+experiment=rotmnist,aug=0.00,param=amortized` yields `https://wandb.ai/.../groups/test_%2Bexperiment%3Drotmnist%2Caug%3D0.00%2Cparam%3Damortized?workspace=user-emilem`.

Would this be specific to something I've done, or are special characters not allowed?

Best,
Emile
