### Current Behavior

I cannot see the git state and repository in my experiments. Please see below:

However, a collaborator on the project has run the same command from the same folder, and in his experiments, git state and repository appear normally. Please see below:

We are both running the latest version of wandb, so I suppose either there is something wrong with my account or there is some kind of environment variable I'm not setting correctly? My github account is associated with my wandb account as well, so this should not be an issue.

Any help would be greatly appreciated :) 

### Expected Behavior

The expect behavior is explained above: the git state and git repository should appear normally.
