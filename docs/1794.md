TITLE:
[Q] Is it possible to use operators like `max`, `mean` or even a `range` in Bar chart's expressions?

LABEL:

BODY:
I would like to compare accuracy of different runs. However, the last entry (epoch) is not representative.

1. Bar chart's expression doesn't seem to work (the suggested `1-${summary:testing_accuracy}` doesn't work)
2. Is there a way to extract the mean or max value over the last 50 entries (epochs)?
