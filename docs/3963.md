[Feature]: Label Images with Run Group

### Description

Some visualizations, like bar charts, are labeled with the run group name, but images show the run name instead.  See this example:

We often organize steps of a multiple step pipeline (e.g train, eval1, eval2, eval3) into a single run group representing an "experiment", so this is an important feature for us. We also typically log many images of time series, maps, etc since we are climate scientists ;)

### Suggested Solution

Label images the same way as the bar chart is labeled.

### Alternatives

Writing a script to make manually make job_name=group name.
