TITLE:
[App]: Long captions are clipped in UI.

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

Long audio captions are clipped and there is no way to see them in full (likely also applies to other media, but did not test).
They are also not centered and look weirdly offset to the right, and are clipped in both, beginning and end:

The only way to see the caption is to open the page source...

### Expected Behavior

The caption is wrapped or otherwise, there is some way to see the caption in full. Long captions are common, for example for ASR or TTS tasks, being able to see just ~100 letters is not enough.
