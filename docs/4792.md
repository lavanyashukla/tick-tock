[Q] Can we access the hyperparameters used to run Sweeps?

Hello there, I was wondering if there's any way we can access the hyperparameters that `wandb agent` runs during Sweeps? I would like to create a python script that calls `wandb sweep`, runs `wandb agent`, gets a set of hyperparameters for that run, and uses those hyperparamters for running another downstream task. Is something like this possible with how Sweeps are defined currently?

I also looked into the high-level overview of sweeps in this [comment](https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/4586#issuecomment-1343170084) and it seems that in my plan above, I am currently bottlenecked by my understanding of how the Sweep Controller samples hyperparameters (that the agent subsequently runs). Any help on this is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!
