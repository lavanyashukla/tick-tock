TITLE:
wandb is leaking file pointers?

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
In my code, I am creating and closing wandb loggers to different projects (I have multiple training pipelines running at the same time). I noticed that wandb seems to be leaking open files. This is causing problems with my code because at a certain point there are too many open files so the job is killed.

Here is a script which replicates this problem:

```
import psutil
import wandb

def print_file_info():
    proc = psutil.Process()
    print('Num open files: %s' % len(proc.open_files()))
    for filename in proc.open_files():
        print('\t%s' % filename.path)

print('Before any WANDB stuff')
print_file_info()
run = wandb.init(project='test', name='test', reinit=True, resume='allow')
run_id = run.id
run.finish()

print('After creating run and getting run ID')
print_file_info()
run = wandb.init(id=run_id, project='test', name='test', reinit=True, resume='allow')
run.finish()

print('After accessing run again')
print_file_info()

test_file = open('test_file.txt', 'w')
print('After creating a normal file pointer')
print_file_info()

test_file.close()
print('After closing that file')
print_file_info()
```

If I run with `WANDB_SILENT=true python wandb_file_leak_test.py`, the output will be something like: 

```
Before any WANDB stuff
Num open files: 0


After creating run and getting run ID
Num open files: 1
	/home/alsuhr/Documents/testing/wandb/run-20201031_132102-j0ebkg08/logs/debug.log


After accessing run again
Num open files: 2
	/home/alsuhr/Documents/testing/wandb/run-20201031_132102-j0ebkg08/logs/debug.log
	/home/alsuhr/Documents/testing/wandb/run-20201031_132106-j0ebkg08/logs/debug.log
After creating a normal file pointer
Num open files: 3
	/home/alsuhr/Documents/testing/wandb/run-20201031_132102-j0ebkg08/logs/debug.log
	/home/alsuhr/Documents/testing/wandb/run-20201031_132106-j0ebkg08/logs/debug.log
	/home/alsuhr/Documents/testing/test_file.txt
After closing that file
Num open files: 2
	/home/alsuhr/Documents/testing/wandb/run-20201031_132102-j0ebkg08/logs/debug.log
	/home/alsuhr/Documents/testing/wandb/run-20201031_132106-j0ebkg08/logs/debug.log
```

Notice how the test file is opened and then the file pointer to it is gone in the last check. What is going on? How can I make sure that these file pointers are actually closed by wandb?

Thanks!

Forgot to mention:
* wandb version 0.10.8
* python version 3.7.6
* `uname -a`: Linux bigbox 4.15.0-112-generic #113~16.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 10 04:37:08 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

More details:
* I can replicate this even if I remove `reinit=True` and `resume='allow'`.
* The documentation seems to suggest this file is only being written to if `WANDB_SILENT=true` (https://docs.wandb.com/library/environment-variables#optional-environment-variables). However, I can replicate this even I remove that environment variable (just set it above so it's easier to read the output).
