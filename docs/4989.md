[Q] Lidar/beta de-duplication

Hi, I'm getting started with lidar visualization (for automotive) and I would like to log the point cloud only once (together with the ground truth) and then log predictions every N epochs during training. Analogously to the example for images:
https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/log/media/image-logging-de-duplication

Can this be accomplished, and if so how? I want to basically do this, but it doesn't seem to work:

In beginning of training:
```
wandb.init()
art = wandb.Artifact("my_lidar_data", "dataset")
for name, points, gt_boxes in LIDAR_DATASET:
    art.add(wandb.Object3D({'type': 'lidar/beta', 'points': points, 'corners': gt_boxes.corners()}), name)
wandb.log_artifact(art)
```

During training:
```
art = wandb.use_artifact("my_lidar_data:latest")
pc_1 = art.get(name)
wandb.log({
    "lidar_prediction": wandb.Object3D({
        'type': 'lidar/beta', 
        'points': pc1, 
        'corners': pred_boxes.corners()
    })
})
```

However, this does not exactly work. Is what I am attempting at all possible, or does the Image visualization type have explicit support to make de-duplication possible?

Thanks in advance :)
