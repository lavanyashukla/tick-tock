TITLE:
[App]: Searching for columns does not display all columns

LABEL:

STATE:

### Current Behavior

I have a number of columns in my runs that start with `train/eat/`, such as `train/eat/final_success_mean`. But in the table view, when I go to add a column, and search for this, they don't show up. Actually, they show up for an instant, and then disappear. This happens in both "fuzzy" and "exact" mode. See this loom for an example: https://www.loom.com/share/484a5c6515754d97b61447e65733ed24
