TITLE:
[CLI] Service worker produces 403 Error in sweep whereas user API Key doesn't

**Description**
I am running a complicated cloud set up for sweeps on Google Cloud Platform. To summarise:
- All configuration of W&B is happening through environment vars, for example: WANDB_API_KEY, WANDB_ENTITY, WANDB_USERNAME, WANDB_PROJECT are set in the environment
- When I use a **service worker API key**, it is unauthorized to upload logs for the sweep runs. I get the following error:  `dropped chunk 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://api.wandb.ai/files/{TEAM_NAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}/{RUN_ID}/file_stream"`
- I have ommited the actual values in the URL above, but the values are correct.
- When I use a User API key, the logging works.

Why is the service worker not working for this configuration? I am unable to view the wandb logs in the container unfortunately.

Thank you in advance
