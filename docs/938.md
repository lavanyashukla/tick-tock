TITLE:
Web UI: Show all runs instead of pagination

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Currently in the table view I see 10 runs and have to click page by page. This makes it hard to compare more than 10 runs, and mouse clicks are annoying. Please consider loading all runs and allowing normal scrolling (if there are too many runs you could do lazy loading).
