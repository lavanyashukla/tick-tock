TITLE:
[Feature request] Treating run duration as a summary metric

LABEL:
feature_request,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I'd like to be able to treat run duration like any other final metric, produces by the run (e.g. like a loss that I record)

Use-case example: 

I'm currently running a sweep (on a single machine) over my hyperparameters. Looking at the parameter importance table w.r.t. losses makes me feel that some parameters that influence the runtime significantly are not actually of much importance to loss values. If true, this might mean that I can make the model more efficient without losing much of accuracy. In this case, I'd need to see an importance plot for the run duration to quickly evaluate this suspicion (and hopefully save running time) =)

P.S. I understand that I can probably make a workaround by recording duration by myself from the training script, but why would I want to do that, if the info is already attached to the run?
