[Feature]: Better display of scalar dispersion when grouping in the web UI

### Description

Spectacular product!

If you choose to group a sweep/etc. to see an ensemble of results, the display of anything with a sequential history is great.  It shows bands and a summary statistics like the median or mean to give a sense of the dispersion.

However, if you are logging a scalar summary value, then it shows the summary statistic but there is no visual way to see the dispersion.  See the following where `test_loss` is something logged at the end of the run for the ensemble within the sweep but which also has plenty of dispersion if you hover over the datapoint.

### Suggested Solution

In a sense, what is plotted is correct because the x-axis is along time/step/etc. so there is no easy way to show it shaded. But some easy way to visualize that dispersion is still helpful.

My suggestion is to keep things simnple.  If the plot is showing a single point with an ensemble then you can have a heuristic width to show it shaded around the point.  The exact width doesn't matter but it could be the entire panel because the x-axis isn't really meaningful in that case.

### Alternatives

On the other hand, the x-axis isn't very meaningful regardless of whatever you choose so maybe the real solution is to selectively change the x-axis when things are only a scalar and do something different.  Almost anything that shows a shaded region to visualize the dispersion like it does for the sequential history would be fine.
