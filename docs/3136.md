**Description**
syncing tfrecord files of old trainings breaks on Windows

**Wandb features**
```bash
wandb sync output
```

**How to reproduce**
1. Add tfevent file in a subfolder named `output`
2. Run 
```bash
wandb sync output
```

3. The output of the command is:
```bash
Found 1 tfevent files in C:\Users\user\path\to\folder
Syncing: https://wandb.ai/team/uncategorized/runs/1gh03dwu ...

```

4. No report is available on WandB if the above code is run on Windows
5. The same above works when run on Linux, but the bash output is slightly different:
```bash
sh-4.2$ wandb sync output
Found 1 tfevent files in /home/ec2-user/SageMaker
Syncing: https://wandb.ai/team/uncategorized/runs/1gh03dwu ...
sh-4.2$  Uploading data to wandb
```

**Environment**
- OS: Windows 10
- Environment: Local bash cmd
- Python Version: [3.9.6]
