TITLE:
Wrong int cast for min and max values of parameters

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I have the following yaml configuration for some parameters:

```
beta:
    min: 0.0
    max: 1.0
```

However, when generating a new sweep with the wandb CLI they are casted to int. From the web interface I can see

```
beta:
   min: 0
   max: 1
```

And so the values are sampled from an integer distribution, instead of a float uniform. Is this a bug or am I missing something?
