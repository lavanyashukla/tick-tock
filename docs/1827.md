TITLE:
[Q] Is there a way to create a confusion matrix that looks like a 2D table?

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I find the confusion_matrix() plot at wandb pretty limiting, as it flattens the results and print them as a table (that can be hard to read if there are many classes.

Is there any functionality to get something more like this https://www.machinecurve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rcf_matrix.png

Thanks!
