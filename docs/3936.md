### Current Behavior

Hi,
I have an error where some videos are logged in at each step and do get recorded in the media folder.
However, when trying to display them in the media object they do not appear. Only the first two (or first depending of the log) do get displayed.

On another run they do get displayed with a slider to select between steps

### Expected Behavior

Been able to display all videos

### Steps To Reproduce

1. go on https://wandb.ai/nicolas-dufour/torchrl/runs/2r54ati0?workspace=user-nicolas-dufour
2. Look at media
3. Look at media folder
