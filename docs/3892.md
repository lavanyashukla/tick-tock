[Q] Wandbcallback keras models get overwritten

BODY:
Hi, im not sure how exactly this happens but my models that I am saving online keep getting overwritten by newer models if saving with wandbcallback, seems like its happening even between projects. My code looks roughly like this:

wandb_run=wandb.init(config=params,project="xxx")
wandb_callback=WandbCallback( log_weights=True)

 model.fit(.... ,callbacks=[wandb_callback])

when restoring model:

best_model = wandb.restore('model-best.h5', run_path="myname/xyz/t0yp5erz")
model.load_weights(best_model.name)

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks for helping!
