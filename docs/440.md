Here's an example of graph where smoothing would be useful:

What's my images per second? 

Here's what this looks like in my [TensorBoard](http://54.236.42.108:6006/#scalars&runSelectionState=eyJlYnMtaW1hZ2VuZXQtMS4wMSI6dHJ1ZSwiZWJzLWltYWdlbmV0LTEiOnRydWV9) with smoothing. I can read my average images per second from the tooltip.

Additional nice feature of Tensorboard, I can type "images" in the top textbox, and it gives me my images_per_second graph right away, no need to click around
