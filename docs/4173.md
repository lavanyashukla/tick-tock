### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
Support for catboost was added to wandb #2975.

However if the function `wandb.catboost.log_summary` does throw an error if `CatBoostRanker` or the `CatBoost` generic booster is passed. It only support `CatBoostClassifier` and `CatBoostRegressor`.

Looking into the `log_summary` as it only calls methods that are available in all four mentioned objects. Thus removing the check at https://github.com/wandb/wandb/blob/4c87b3676c464414d31550e52564dd0c7fec577a/wandb/integration/catboost/catboost.py#L160 would immediately yield full support for CatBoost.
