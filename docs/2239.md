TITLE:
[App] Confusion matrix widget mixes up data when there are several confussion matrices available

**Describe the bug**
I regularly use sweep to run experiments. And in cases where confusion matrices are useful, I log the proper data. However, when visualizing it, confusion matrices data is shown all at once, making it really hard to read anything (even when only one run is selected as visualized).

**To Reproduce**
Run a sweep and log a confusion matrix when evaluating the model:
```python
    wandb.log({
        "matrix": wandb.sklearn.plot_confusion_matrix(
            flat_true_labels, flat_true_predictions, label_list
        )
    })
```

**Expected behavior**
I would expect confusion matrices to be tied to a run, or at least some way to filter out the data so only one matrix is displayed at a time.

Moreover, the data seems to be logged correctly, as it gets back from the server just fine. Here's an example upon inspecting the XHR requests: [matrix.json.txt](https://github.com/wandb/client/files/6564947/matrix.json.txt)
