### Current Behavior

When I using the csv export function to export my sweep data, some columns of data are just empty, and I can see them on the web table app. In the downloaded csv file, there is just the column names, not the data, that is a very bad situation for a data logging tool.

### Expected Behavior

All logged data should be in the downloaded csv file.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to table view of a sweep.
2. click the export button and chose the csv export function.
3. download the file and check it out.

### Screenshots

In the web table app, the values are just there:
