TITLE:
[CLI] Runs filters don't work with config names that contain periods

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
When the logged config keys contain a period (e.g. `config.model.type`), any filters in `wandb.api.runs(filters={...})` seem to be ignored.

**Wandb features**
I am using `wandb.Api().runs()` only.

**How to reproduce**
1. Link to a reproducible script we can run to see the bug
2. Describe what we have to do in order to trigger the issue
3. Add a zip file with the run folder 

Reproducible script, assuming it queries a workspace with at least one run that has a config key named `example.key`:

```python
import wandb
api = wandb.Api()
runs = api.runs(path="<entity>/<project>", filters={"config.example.key": "test_value"})
print(len(runs))

"""
Output:
0
"""
```

**Environment**
- Client version: 0.12.5 (latest version on Conda Forge)
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS
- Environment: Local Anaconda installation on linux-64 platform
- Python Version: 3.9.7
