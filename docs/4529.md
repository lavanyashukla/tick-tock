TITLE:
[CLI]: setting wandb disabled doesn't fully disable it

### Describe the bug

I'm using a performance profiler `viztracer` on a pytorch training routine that uses wandb. It seems like there's some interference between the tracer and wandb that causes wandb to crash. So I figure I can just disable wandb (`$ wandb disabled`) , but it still crashes with a bug deep inside wandb - it seems like wandb is still trying to launch the service process or something even when it's set to disabled!

Here's the traceback - the first 2 lines are from some logging that I added in the wandb code to try to figure out what was going on. I'm guessing the tracer somehow patched `python` and it no longer supports `-m`? But the solution IMO is really that wandb should not be trying to start a process at all when disabled. 
```
$ viztracer --min_duration 10us --ignore_c_function --ignore_frozen my_script.py

No such file as -m

```


Btw this script is sufficient to replicate the issue when called by viztracer as shown above:
```
import wandb

if __name__ == "__main__":
    wandb.init()
```
