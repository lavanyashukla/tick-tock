TITLE:
[CLI]: Logging code in separate runs using multiprocessing creates deadlock

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
When wandb logs artifacts, specifically code, it is for some reason requesting some file permissions that can create deadlock. This error manifests when a race condition is met, so is transient, but can be easily reproduced if you simply initiate a large number of runs that all do the same thing. It's worth mentioning that if I replace the line 'wandb run log code' with my own implementation of a function with the same functionality (iterates over fds, checks whether they are valid, then uploads only the diffs to a remote server over ssh) this error does not occur.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
import wandb
wandb.init()
wandb.run.log_code("/your/library/here/")
```

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: conflict detected for file digest 0Jk9O1SycvE+N699TA6aZg==, rebase required (<Response [409]>)
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: conflict detected for file digest 0Jk9O1SycvE+N699TA6aZg==, rebase required (<Response [409]>)
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: conflict detected for file digest 0Jk9O1SycvE+N699TA6aZg==, rebase required (<Response [409]>)
```

This error is mentioned by multiple users recently in #1407 but it is closed so I am making a new issue here.
