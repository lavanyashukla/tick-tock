TITLE:
[Q] Check sweep controller by name.

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I'm trying to resume sweeps by name instead of `sweep_id`. 

Is there a way to check for the status of a sweep controller by name + project name

OR

Get the entire set of sweeps under an entity (kind of like how you can with runs within a project)
```
api = wandb.Api()

api.runs(f"{ENTITY}/{project_name}")
```
