[Q] How to log the real GPU memory allocation?

Hi,
First, this product is really amazing! I love it!

I know that wandb logs the GPU memory allocation out-of-the-box, but it does it in percentage (%).

Is there any way to log the memory allocation in gigabytes?

Since my runs get allocated to different GPUs with different memories, I frequently find myself looking at the percentage graph produced by wandb, looking for the used GPU, searching online for its total memory capacity and computing the allocated GPU memory in Gb.

It would be nice to present such a graph out of the box.

Is it doable, or I should submit a feature-request?
