TITLE:
[Q] Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization

LABEL:
feature_request,c:sweeps

STATE:
open

BODY:
Often when I want to do hyperparameter optimization I have multiple metrics I would like to optimize for.

I would like some kind of multiobjective hyperparameter optimization that can search for and find the optimal frontier.

Is there any way to do this in the current version of wandb?
