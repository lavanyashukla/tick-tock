### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
Updating the wandb summary dictionary with a tensor or NumPy array should persist that data as a binary file according to the documentation. However, it does not seem possible to access the underlying tensors. 
<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
meta = wandb.api.download_url("project", "wandb.h5", "entity", "run-id")
path, res = api.download_write_file(meta, out_dir="/your/directory/here")
```

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'Api' object has no attribute 'download_write_file'
```
