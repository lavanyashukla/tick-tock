TITLE:
[Q] Verbose Error Output

LABEL:

BODY:
Is there a setting to create verbose error messages? i.e. if a run fails for a FileNotFoundError, I'd like to know which file was not found. I have an issue where my runs and sweeps are fine locally, yet are failing in a cloud instance; and I have no way of knowing which file path caused the error in the cloud run.
