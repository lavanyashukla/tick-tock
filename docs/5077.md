[Q] Why does a model download from a registry create a run?

Hi, I'm trying to understand the reasoning behind why downloading a model from the Model Registry requires creating, logging, and syncing a run.


I have a Github action that runs every now and then and it downloads the models from the model registry into a directory. I've noticed that I have tons of runs logged that serve no other purpose other than I guess noting when a particular model was downloaded.

This is the function that runs as part of my Github action:

```
def fetch_model_from_wandb(registry_name: str, model_version: str, path_to_save: str) -> None:
    """
    This function fetches the model_version from a given model_registry from W&B
    Args:
        registry_name (str): name of the registry as defined in W&B model registry
        model_version (str): the model version as defined in the W&B model registry.
        path_to_save (str): the path where the model is downloaded.
    """
    run = wandb.init()
    artifact = wandb.use_artifact(f'<MY-ENTITY>/model-registry/{registry_name}:{model_version}', type='model')
    artifact_dir = artifact.download(path_to_save)
    logging.info(f"model saved to: {artifact_dir}")
    run.finish()
```

Is there a way to download from Model Registry without logging runs?
