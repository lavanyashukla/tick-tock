TITLE:
There should probably be a message if you wandb pull on an empty bucket

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Right now it looks like

```
  % wandb pull bottle-angle                                                                                                     !10664
Downloading: bottle-angle/bottle-angle
```

And then returns happily.  Maybe it should say "bottle-angle/bottle-angle is empty"
