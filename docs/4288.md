[Feature]: Quartiles in chart grouping.

### Description

Hi WandB,

It would be really useful if you could add quartiles to the grouping of samples in the web GUI.  You have the median as an option for the aggregate, and the most natural range metric for that is quartiles.  It is also asymmetric which is useful (unlike i.e. stddev). 

Thank you very much!
Andy

### Suggested Solution

Add a grouping option for quartiles.  

### Alternatives

N-th percentiles is also an option (i.e. user-specified upper and lower percentiles) but that seems more involved.
