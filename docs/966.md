### Description

I have uploaded a lot of tabular data as part of my runs using wandb Tables. 

`table = wandb.Table(columns=["Text", "Result1", "Result2"])`

I would like to compute metrics based on this tabular data (e.g. column 1 row 1 + column 2 row 2) and use that summary metric to compare between runs, but I cannot see a way to:

* compare items of tabular data e.g. like above or
* easily export tabular data across a large number of runs for external processing to achieve the above

Is the recommended solution that all tabular data is also uploaded as individual items, e.g. a 2x2 table with 2 headers is better uploaded as four individual 1D scalars?

A related question on how to compare scalars in wandb: I know its possible to use expressions on single plots to do e.g. s (e.g. (accuracy + precision) / 2). Is it possible to do the same thing across many runs as part of a sweep? Or a way to easily retrospectively add this if it was not originally wandb.log-ed?
