TITLE:
[App]: Legend has no color and displays traces with no data

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

In this project-page plot, I'm combining data from multiple runs that log the same metric but on two different keys (because they were trained on different libraries). So I have set the y-axis to display both keys so that I can see all the runs on the same graph. But the legend is all broken.

- first, the legend is all grey, so it's impossible to match the label with the trace
- second, i would like only (run, metric_key) pairs that actually have data to have an entry in the legend. in this case, since i have 4 runs, and each run has data on only one of the keys, i expect 4 entries in the legend, but instead there is an entry for all 8 (run, metric_key) pairs.
