Pyinstaller packaging app throws Module Not Found Error

### Describe the bug

Hi, I trying to pack an app into exe using `Pyinstaller`which is using `wandb `. The app is packaged successfully but on executing it throws below error:

`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'wandb_gql'
[3424] Failed to execute script 'DemoProgram' due to unhandled exception!`

The part where `wandb ` is being imported

`
import wandb
from wandb.keras import WandbCallback
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
`
I believe there should be some kind of `hook` for including `wandb` into the packaged exe while packaging using Pyinstaller.

Kindly refer to above issue..
