TITLE:
Getting a lot of "cannot import name 'introspection_query'" errors

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I've been getting a lot of these errors when running Jupyter notebooks intermittently - across colab, jupyterlab and kaggle:

{code:python}
ImportError: cannot import name 'introspection_query'
{code}

Running the cell again seems to fix the error most time. Sometimes I need to refresh the cell a few times.
