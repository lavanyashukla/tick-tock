[Q] Why Optuna's suggest categorical params are not logged and shown in the UI?

Hello guys, I have a burning question. I am running Optuna with wandb and values from _suggest_categorical_ are not logged and shown in the UI.

Let take this as an example. Binary won't be visible, but min_df - will be:

For binary I am getting such mesage:

To help Google track it, this is a message:
_Selected runs are not logging media for the key binary, but instead are logging values of type number.
If binary is never supposed to be a media type, please delete this panel and create the proper panel type manually._

It happens with every _suggest_categorical_ parameter I tried (both string and bool) and it is very annoying, as values like binary for sklean vectorizers is a big tuning option. How to fix that?

Example code:

```
def objective(trial):
    params = {
        'vectorizer': {
            'name': 'tfidf',
            'params': {
                'binary': trial.suggest_categorical('binary', [True, False]),
                'min_df': trial.suggest_int('min_df', low=0, high=100, step=5)
            }
        }
    }

    X_train, X_val, _, y_train, y_val, _ = loading(split_train_val=True)
    vectorizer, X_train_vec, X_val_vec, _ = vectorization(params, X_train, X_val=X_val)
    model = training(params, X_train_vec, y_train)
    _, val_f1_score = evaluate(model, X_val_vec, y_val)
    return val_f1_score

def run(config: dict = None, params: dict = None) -> None:
    wandbc = WeightsAndBiasesCallback(metric_name='val_f1')
    print('Starting optuna...')
    study = optuna.create_study(direction='maximize')
    study.optimize(objective, n_trials=3, callbacks=[wandbc])

```

### Additional context (optional)

I can ommit this issue by custom code in the objective method:

```
trial_params = dict(trial.params)
wandb.log(data={"vec_binary": int(trial_params['binary'] == True)}, step=trial.number)
```
I need to manually replace it with ints.
