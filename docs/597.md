### Description

I'm running multiple `wandb agent`s in order to parallelize my grid search, and for each of them I have to set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to make them run on different GPUs. It would be really nice if there was a built-in feature to distribute agents over multiple GPUs.

There also seems to be an issue where starting two agents at the same time (e.g. in a script) makes them get the same parameters for the first run. A little delay fixes it though.
