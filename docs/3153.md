TITLE:
[Q] Best way to alternate between using sweeps and choosing hyperparameters manually? (K-Fold Cross Validation)

LABEL:

BODY:
I'm looking for a way to incorporate sweeps into my training script which will allow me to do:
- Manual runs
- K-Fold Cross Validation using the same hyperparameters (I split my dataset differently on each run) 
- (Optional) Hyperparameter tuning 

-----

Currently, my main function definition is like so: `main(hparams)` - it accepts a single parameter, which is a hyperparameter dictionary of form:
```
hparams = {
    'lr': lr,
    ....
}
```
This allows me to perform runs by **choosing the hyperparameters manually**. 
I can also loop this to perform **K-Fold Cross Validation**. 

-----

Using `optuna`, I can also performing **hyperparameter tuning** with something like:
```
hparams1 = {
    'lr': trial.suggest_categorical('lr', [1e^-4, 1e^-3]),
    ....
}
```

-----

While my set-up works, it would be great to get wandb integration and see these in the "Sweeps" section of my project - which is why I would like to make the switch to wandb sweeps. 

-----

It's my understand that sweeps require hyperparameters for the form:
```
sweep_hparams = {
    'lr': {
        'value': lr
    }, 
    ...
}

sweep_config = {
    'name': ....,
    'method': 'random',
    'parameters': sweep_hparams,
    ...
}
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep_config)
wandb.agent(
    sweep_id,
    function=main( ''' ? '''),
    count=3
```
The issue with this (with respect to my script) is that I can't access the hyperparameters (for logging and so on, since I need to pass `main` the `hparams` dictionary for that). How can I access the hyperparameters for this particular sweep-run?
