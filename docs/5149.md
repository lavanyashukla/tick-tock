TITLE:
[Q] Windows latest-run folder is not created inside wandb folder

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
I created this minimalistic example and tested on windows, macos, and linux (ubuntu).

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
import os
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import Model
from tensorflow.keras import layers
import wandb

os.system("wandb offline")
wandb.init()

#create some dummy data
inputs_dataset = np.random.rand(10, 1)
outputs_dataset = np.random.rand(10, 1)

# create a dummy model
some_inputs = layers.Input(shape=(1), name='some_inputs')
outputs = layers.Dense(1)(some_inputs)
model = Model(inputs=some_inputs, outputs=outputs)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='mse')

# create a wandb callback
wandb_callback = wandb.keras.WandbCallback(
                monitor='val_loss',
                save_model=True,
                validation_data=(inputs_dataset, outputs_dataset))

# train
history = model.fit(
        x=inputs_dataset, y=outputs_dataset,
        epochs=2,
        validation_data=(inputs_dataset, outputs_dataset),
        callbacks=[wandb_callback],
    )

```
In both cases a folder `wandb` is created but while in macos (and ubuntu) a folder `latest-run` was created, in windows it didn't. 
Also, `latest-run` is a simlink to the run folder with latest creation date.

_-> My Question:_
Is this behaviour intended? Is there an easy way to retrieve the latest-run without synchronizing wandb?

_-> Context:_
I want to check that in the latest-run folder certain files have been created, thus I need the path to `files` folder inside the latest run.
This is in the context of unit tests, so I don't want to set-up a local server with docker for dryruns, and I don't want to synchronize and then retrieve the run ID because these are unit tests and I don't want to pollute my workspace.
Right now my tests pass in macos and in linux, but not in windows simply because `latest-run` is not created.

Thanks!
