[Feature]: Ability to merge old runs with a new run

### Description

Hi, 

Sometimes one trains a model for a long time, and this process takes several runs. It would be nice if one could merge old runs with an existing run. I know that there is an option to resume an old run, but sometimes a user might prefer to keep the code simpler and merge the runs themselves through the UI (which is what I am asking for). 

Thank you :)

### Suggested Solution

I would like to have the ability to drag an old run into a new run (through the UI) in order to merge them.
