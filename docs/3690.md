TITLE:
[Q] How does `wandb.log` work with JAX's asynchronous dispatch?

BODY:
Many frameworks like JAX utilize [asynchronous dispatch](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/async_dispatch.html) for improved accelerator utilization. How does this work with `wandb.log`? If I log a metric on every batch does that have the effect of blocking execution until the logged metric's `DeviceArray` becomes available?

There's also the question of buffering network requests. Does every `wandb.log` invoke a separate network request? If they are batched, what is the batching strategy? Are network requests blocking?
