TITLE:
Allow longer list-like objects to be stored without converting to histogram.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
WandB converts any list-like object larger than 32 elements to a histogram automatically, and there is no way to avoid this behaviour.  This is incredibly frustrating as I want to track some arrays with size greater than 32, but they are compiled into a histogram from which I cannot get the original values out.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add an argument to `init` that sets the maximum size at which list-like entries are summarised into histograms.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I could store the arrays as images, but this is an irritating work-around and makes it less immediately compatible with the other metrics up- and down-stream.

Thanks,
A
