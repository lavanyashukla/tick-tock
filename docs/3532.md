[CLI]: wandb.Video takes a very long time

### Describe the bug

Running wandb.Video when providing a numpy array takes a very long time. Using the profiler I found that the issue is the quantization of the frames for the GIF that is created by default. I suggest changing the format to be mp4 by default, this avoids this quantization and runs much faster. Also, it might be wise to change the default FPS to something other than 4. 

If the above changes are not desired for some reason, I suggest you update the documentation on the website to inform of this behavior and maybe also add an FAQ item for this.

Thanks!
