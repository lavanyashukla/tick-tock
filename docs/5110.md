TITLE:
[CLI]: wandb sync --include-synced does not sync

### Describe the bug

Some runs failed to sync due to rate limits. Trying to sync them after they are finished with `wandb sync --include-synced` gives:
```
wandb: Number of runs to be synced: 1
wandb:   wandb/run-20230306_121602-c1sthkpz
wandb: NOTE: use wandb sync --clean to delete 1 synced runs from local directory.
```
But nothing is actually synced, or at least no changes in the UI.
