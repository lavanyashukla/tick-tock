Impossible to change run ID if wandb.init() is called after wandb.agent()

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
Suppose one wants to perform a hyper-parameter step in an ML pipeline and then wants to learn a model with the best hyper-parameter configuration found. Suppose also that one wants to perform this two steps within the same process. 
In Weights and Biases, this can be done by performing a sweep, with a call to wandb.agent(), followed by a run that trains the model with the best hyper-parameters found by the wandb agent. This second step can be obtained by calling wandb.init().

However, if you call wandb.init() after a wandb.agent() call, the run created by wandb.init() is not a new run, as one expects. Instead, it is exactly the last run of the sweep, again (?). In other words, the last run of the sweep seems to be still alive when I call wandb.init(). So, even if I call wandb.init() to create a new run, wandb is still referring to the last sweep run. I am not able to understand how this is possible. Even if I force wandb to change the ID of the run explicitly, the run ID does not change.

I found a similar issue https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/1529, however, my case is different since the issue argues this problem within the runs in the same sweep. In my case, we have this problem between the last run of the sweep and the first run created after the sweep. I tried the solution proposed in the issue but, as you can see in the code snippet and in the log information, it does not seem to work.

Here, I post a simple code snippet to show the problem. I simply defined a trivial sweep, with no-sense content on it, and then called a wandb.agent() followed by a wandb.init(). Here, we have to pay attention to the printed IDs of the runs and their names. As you can see, the first two runs of the sweep are just ok, with different IDs and names. Then, the third run seems to be still alive when I call wandb.init() after the sweep is ended. In fact, even if I set reinit=True and force the run to have a new ID, the ID of the last run of the sweep is preserved on the new run I am trying to create. In other words, they are the same run. However, it seems it is possible to change its name, as you can see from the logged information (I highlighted IDs and names of runs in bold in order to find them in the log). In addition, you can see that the log shows that the run is detected as a sweep run, even if it is out of the context of the agent and run after the agent should have finished its task.

```python
import wandb
import random
import os


def train():
    with wandb.init(project="ciao") as run:
        print(run.id)
        run.name = "run_1"
        print(run.name)
        for i in range(10):
            wandb.log({"metric": i * random.randint(0, 10)})


def reset_wandb_env():
    exclude = {
        "WANDB_PROJECT",
        "WANDB_ENTITY",
        "WANDB_API_KEY",
    }
    for k, v in os.environ.items():
        if k.startswith("WANDB_") and k not in exclude:
            del os.environ[k]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    sweep_id = wandb.sweep({
      "method": "random",
      "metric": {"goal": "maximize", "name": "metric"},
      "parameters":
          {
            "p1": {"values": [1, 2, 3, 4]},
            "p2": {"values": [9, 3]}}}, project="ciao")
    # find the best model with a sweep
    wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=train, count=3)
    reset_wandb_env()
    with wandb.init(project="ciao", reinit=True, id="new_id", name="run_2") as run:
        # training of the best model with a simple run
        print(run.id)
        print(run.name)
```
