STATE:

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
When I try to group by common_input...policy_regularization...weight, it shows an error: "There was a problem rendering these panels."
If I group by another field (like common_input...algo), it does work as expected.

**To Reproduce**
1. Go to https://wandb.ai/kaiwenw/CartPole-v0/sweeps/2hoqa0oe?workspace=user-kaiwenw.
2. Group by common_input...policy_regularization...weight
3. See error

**Expected behavior**
Expect group by to work as expected.
