[Q]: How to show the latest logged metrics for runs on the plot.

Hi, I am evaluating a few models and log test accuracies. Figured out I had made a mistake in my eval script and test accuracy comes up as nonsense value for a single run. I have fixed the bug and re-run it. Now the metrics are true.
Results of the 1th run can be seen in the chart below (accuracy - Step);

Problem is, I see only the oldest metrics for runs when I want to compare with other runs and couldn't make it work. Example below;

How can I fix the bar of the 1th experiment (or all) to show the latest logged metric?

I hope It is explained clearly. Thanks for your helps.
