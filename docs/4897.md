### Describe the bug

When calling `wand.init()` with an `id=123` of a run that has previously been deleted via the web interface, the wandb daemon enters an endless retry loop:

>wandb: Currently logged in as: REDACTED. Use `wandb login --relogin` to force relogin
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: run REDACTED/test/2281463 was previously created and deleted; try a new run name (<Response [409]>)
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: run REDACTED/test/2281463 was previously created and deleted; try a new run name (<Response [409]>)

### Additional Context

This happened because I use the  `SLURM_JOB_ID` as wandb job id and am currently testing continuation of preempted jobs inside an interactive slurm job (i.e. the slurm job id always stays the same). The likeliness of this happening in a real scenario is small in my opinion.
