### Description

wandb on/off not working.

### What I Did
I noticed wandb on/off was not working so I tried setting the environment variable 'WANDB_MODE' manually and found that it worked as expected. Then I tried using 'wandb on/off' and found that it had no effect on the environment variable (See output below). 
Installations were made inside a conda environment, if that matters.

```
$ wandb off
W&B disabled, running your script from this directory will only write metadata locally.
$ echo $WANDB_MODE
run
$ wandb on
W&B enabled, running your script from this directory will now sync to the cloud.
$ echo $WANDB_MODE
run
$ wandb off
W&B disabled, running your script from this directory will only write metadata locally.
$ echo $WANDB_MODE

```
