[App] Bar chart using box plot full screen display issue

Hello Everyone,

Earlier this week I noticed a UI problem when displaying bar chart in full screen using box plot vertically on wandb.com. The full chart would continuously spread across vertically and will not be stopped unless the full screen is closed. I ran this both on latest safari on Mac and on chrome on ubuntu with the same outcome. Only happens if I use full screen.

Thanks!
