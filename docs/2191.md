Plotly plots not showing properly on the dashboard

I am trying to plot a stack of images as an animation frame (example "Exploring 3-D images and timeseries with animation_frame" in https://plotly.com/python/imshow/). I can correctly plot with plotly, but when I log on wandb I see an empty space, with the sliding bar. 

The code I'm running is: 

```python
import wandb
wandb.init(project="plot tests")

import plotly.express as px
from skimage import io
data = io.imread("https://github.com/scikit-image/skimage-tutorials/raw/main/images/cells.tif")
img = data[25:40]
fig = px.imshow(img, animation_frame=0, binary_string=True, labels=dict(animation_frame="slice"))

wandb.log({"my_chart": fig})
```

And here's what I get in wandb

I run the code on my Windows machine: 
 - OS: Windows 10
 - Browser: tested on both Chrome and Safari 
 - Version [e.g. 22] wandb version: '0.10.30', plotly version: 4.14.3
