TITLE:
Sweeps: Detect OOM and stop launching new runs

LABEL:

BODY:
**Problem or Use Case**
When my server runs out of disk memory, wandb's logging fails but still restarts. As a result, my sweeps will be filled with 10k failed sweeps.

**Suggested Solution**
Can we detect when this happens and auto-stop?
Perhaps a good heuristic is if runs take less than 10s and there're several rounds of sweep workers failing.
This can also be an "early stopping" knob that can be disabled on the UI.
