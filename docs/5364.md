[Q] wandb ValueError

BODY:
I'm working with a codebase: https://github.com/samuela/git-re-basin.

Trying to reproduce the plots for `cifar10_mlp_weight_matching.py` using Weights & Biases with compiling script: `python src/cifar10_mlp_weight_matching.py --model-a mlp_0 --model-b mlp_1 --load-epoch 10`. However, resulting in a wandb ValueError that the project doesn't contain artifact. Shown below:

`wandb: ERROR Project <entity>/<project> does not contain artifact: "cifar10-mlp-weights:mlp_0"`
