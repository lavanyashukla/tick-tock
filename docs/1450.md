Overwriting sessions

BODY:
Hi,

I would like to experiment with my code, running it multiple times in a row while debugging/tuning it  without creating a single session for every run, instead having one session that keeps getting overwritten every time, to avoid spamming the project with lots of sessions. 

I used to do this on visdom easily by always using the same name for my env and clearing it in the code automatically. Is there a way to do this on wandb? From what I can see deleting runs from the code is possible but it is said in the docs you can't use the ID from the deleted session, so I don't really see how I could do what I describe above.

Thanks a lot.
