TITLE:
[Q]Can we use wandb with tensorboard log file (log_dir) directly?

BODY:
Currently,I am using tensorboard logging for one of my MT work.
 I directly launch tensorboard logging using below cli
tensorboard --logdir='runs/logs' --port=8080

I wish to use the same logdir with wandb. Can I use it somehow.
I dont wish to make changes in my training script(train.py) and integrate wandb there.
