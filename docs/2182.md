**Describe the bug**
I am logging a wandb.Image at the end of every epoch. The docs state that you should log less than 50 at every step, so that should be fine. However I get the following behavior when trying to look at the Images in the wandb web app:

Sometimes the web app also crashes like this after some time

Indeed, I cannot find the images that are said to be "missing" in the video in the logged files. I have the following error in my training run, but the training continues:

So it seems like some error occurs when transferring the files and after that point, no more images are uploaded. However, metrics continue to be logged. Do you have any idea what is going on here and how I could fix this?
