### Description

I'm looking for a way to do a plot of a subset of the runs in a panel, without trigger the visibilities of the runs entirely. For example, Panel A plots validation accuracy of runs A to C, Panel B plots validation accuracy of runs D to F. 

### Suggested Solution

Options to select and deselect runs within panel settings

### Alternatives

_No response_

### Additional Context
