TITLE:
[CLI] ~/.cache directory unbounded in size

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
wandb apparently keeps a folder for caching objects at ~/.cache/wandb. When running a ton of sweeps, some of which may fail, the size of this directory can be pretty huge since the objects aren't cleaned up. For example, mine was ~400GB. This obviously needs to be cleaned up automatically somehow or at least monitored to warn the user that this is happening.

**Wandb features**
Sweeps w/ Pytorch Lightning

**How to reproduce**
1. Run a sweep which keeps things in the .cache directory
2. Observe growth

**Environment**
- OS: Linux
- Environment: GCP
- Python Version: 3.9
