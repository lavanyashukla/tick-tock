Custom Vega Plots Crashing[App]: 

LABEL:

STATE:

### Current Behavior

When adding a custom plot panel I can get around the bug of not being able to access the run history keys by selecting 'summary' first, selecting the keys and then switching to history(). However, inside the edit tab any changes to the code I make crashes the app. Specifically adding a comma causes the crash most often.

Any help or a fix for the vega implementation would be really helpful. All I want to do is add grid lines to the plot at specific intervals.

### Expected Behavior

Not crashing when editing the vega code in custom plots.

### Steps To Reproduce

Go to 'Add panel'
click 'custom chart'
click 'edit'
add a comma anywhere in the vega script
