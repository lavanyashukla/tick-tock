BODY:
The work was started here: https://github.com/wandb/client/tree/feature/parcoor

We need to hookup highlighting, CSS, and the custom d3.brushes on the columns as is implemented in https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/feature/parcoor/wandb/board/ui/src/components/PanelParallelCoord.js

The legacy component uses d3 version 3 and the brush API has changed: https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md#brushes-d3-brush
