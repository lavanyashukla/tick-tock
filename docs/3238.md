LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
`wandb.save(glob_str='snapshots/shapshot_*', policy='now')` is non-blocking call and i want to know whether snapshot has synced with server.
It is necessary to send message to another process that would download last snapshot from W&B server, create videos with this snapshot and upload videos to the corresponding run.
