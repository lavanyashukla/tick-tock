TITLE:
[Feature]: Redesigning Core Keras WandbCallback Features

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
### Description

Hey all, I am creating this issue to better track all the PRs from one place. The Keras `WandbCallback` is great but, at this point, has gotten convoluted with many features, making it hard for Keras users to use it to its fullest. This work is done to have multiple callbacks that Keras users can use per the need. We will be creating one PR per callback such that it's easy to review them thoroughly and we can have proper testing for them.

Work done with @soumik12345. 



### Suggested Solution

As per our initial work and multiple internal discussions with @morganmcg1 and the SDK team, we propose to add these features: 

* `WandbMetricsLogger` - for basic experiment tracking.
* `WandbCheckpointing` - for model checkpointing via W&B artifacts.
* `WandbGradientLogger` - for logging gradients of the layer.
* `BaseWandbEvalCallback` - base callback for building evaluation table for model pred visualization.
* `FLOPsLogger` - for logging the FLOPs count of the model.

These are the core redesign elements. cc: @soumik12345 @morganmcg1
