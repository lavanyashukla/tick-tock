[Q] Download run.files in parallel?

Hi, I'm using the run api to download files from a finished run like below.
```
api = wandb.Api()
runs = api.runs(f"research/{project}")
run = runs[0]
for file in run.files:
  file.download(root=folder)
```

This works fine. However, when I have many files and want to use multiprocess to download in parallel, it says the run.files is not pickable. Is there any way to solve this?
