### Description

I have been a user of wandb for over a year now, and I find it to be a great tool for tracking my experiments. However, one thing that has been missing for me is the ability to visually highlight the minimum and maximum values for a metric in the graph. While it is possible to log the min and max values of a metric or loss separately, this does not provide a visual perception of the minimum and maximum values within the graph. This would be especially useful for identifying particular epochs for further investigation, for example, by highlighting the minimum and maximum values for accuracy

### Suggested Solution

Something like this which will enable us to highlight the min and max value,

### Alternatives

_No response_

### Additional Context

I believe this feature would be highly beneficial for the wandb community and would greatly improve the overall user experience. I hope you consider my request and implement this feature in a future update.
