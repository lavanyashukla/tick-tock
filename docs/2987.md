**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

We use custom layers/losses that cannot be saved to Keras' h5 format...they work fine with the [SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model) format. We save them like this: https://github.com/ai2cm/fv3net/blob/09470013f69bab552d765abc7f44bcbbe3768e6a/external/fv3fit/fv3fit/emulation/keras.py#L16

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Generalize this hardcoded filepath: https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/29009975544d11b8b3c172ce5f537d8a5e63898a/wandb/integration/keras/keras.py#L374

More generally allow user to provide their own custom function (for checkpointing the mode to disk. There are many corner cases here (e.g. custom losses cannot be serialized cleanly)...so WandBCheckpoint should provide some escape valves.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

Writing my own checkpointing callback.

**Additional context**
