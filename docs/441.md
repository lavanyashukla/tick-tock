TITLE:

### Description

When trying to log any data to `wandb` when jupyter notebook is set to have a password, you get an error `Failed to query for notebook kernels`:

Under some circumstances this exception is not caught at all and crashes training with a similar stack trace:

```
Failed to query for notebook sessions
Traceback (most recent call last):

```

### What I Did

1. Set a password for jupyter notebook by editing `.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` to have a password. What this means is that no metadata about the jupyter notebook is logged to wandb:

``` python
# sets the password to "hello"
c.NotebookApp.password = u'sha1:ce33f1754029:ba4f0af9b0a9a5da036ae6649d4515a85c2fe211'
```

2. Create a new jupyter notebook and try to log anything:

```
import wandb
wandb.init()
wandb.log({'x': 123})
```

3. The `Failed to query for notebook kernels` error is shown and no metadata from jupyter is logged.

### Root Cause

This [line of code](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/jupyter.py#L95) assumes that there is a token available. This is only true for token authentication. If you set a password for your jupyter server (very common!) the `token` field will be blank from `list_running_servers`:

The API call to `/api/sessions` then fails as the authentication fails.

There are a few solutions in this [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40000657/interact-with-password-protected-jupyter-api) post - but none are ideal as you have to pass the password through.
