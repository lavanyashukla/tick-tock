[App] Frozen line plot for over 10,000 steps

**Describe the bug**
In some cases, after a long time, the line plot of the validation accuracy in a remains constant at 0.5 for 10,000 steps. This is suspicious, because the train accuracy, as well as **train and valid losses, continue to update.**

Because the validation loss continues to change significantly, I wonder why the validation is changing even with 0.0001 over so many steps. Are there current relevant wandb known issues?
