### Description

I was trying to create multiple wandb runs and switch back and forth between them to make the updates.

### What I Did

```
import wandb
run = wandb.init(name='aaa', id='1234', project='test3', resume=True, reinit=True)
print(run.step) 
run.log({'x':0.1}, step=0)
print(run.step)
wandb.join()
run = wandb.init(name='aab', id='1235', project='test3', resume=True, reinit=True)
run.log({'x':0.3}, step=0)
print(run.step)
wandb.join()
run = wandb.init(name='aaa', id='1234', project='test3', resume=True, reinit=True)
print(run.step)


```
The expected output above should be 0, 0, 0, 1 but I am getting 0, 0, 0, 2 here. If I increase the number of the runs the behavior becomes even more unpredictable. Is there an issue in how I used the API? I didn't set any environment variables.
