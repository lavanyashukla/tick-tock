[Q] Sweeping during a dry run wandb.sweep

BODY:
Hi i'm trying to sweep during a dry run (no internet) and an error keeps being thrown .

The line

 `sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep_config, project="basic hyperparam optimisation")`

requests http access. It is used to initialise the sweep with

`wandb.agent(sweep_id, train)`

My environment variables are set and this run works on a computer with internet (just fails as cuda runs out of memory)

os.environ["WANDB_ENTITY"]="rpatel9"
os.environ["WANDB_PROJECT"]="basic hyperparam optimisation"
os.environ["WANDB_MODE"] = "dryrun"

**How do I initialise the sweep to be run offline? I'm using the simpletransformers library**
