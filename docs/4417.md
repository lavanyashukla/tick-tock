### Describe the bug

Running wandb in regular, online mode, there is no problem. But on a cluster with no internet on compute nodes, when I run it in offline mode, there is no file generated corresponding to the configuration information of the experiment. This is not a sync issue; even manually inspecting the *local* files on my cluster, it seems that the file that would normally contain the config JSON is not created.
