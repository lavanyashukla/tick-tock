### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

Hello,

I am launching a multi run with hydra. One of those run contains an error. I expect to see on the dashboard that the run failed but it displays that the run finished. Additionally, the logs on each run seems incoherent. Below is a minimal code snippet:

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->

There are two configurations. If we run the configuration `model1` we compute `k -> k**2` for `k in [0,99]`. If we run the configuration `model2` we compute `k -> k**factor` with factor an integer specified in the config file. The error introduced here is that `factor` is never specified in the file, so the line `factor=cfg.model.factor` fails.
```python
import hydra
from omegaconf import  OmegaConf

import wandb


@hydra.main(version_base=None, config_path="minimal_conf", config_name="minimal_config")
def main(cfg):
    print(OmegaConf.to_yaml(cfg))
    my_cfg = OmegaConf.to_container(cfg, resolve=True, throw_on_missing=True)
    run = wandb.init(
        project="Test-multirun",
        entity="pablo2909",
        settings=wandb.Settings(start_method="thread"),
        config=my_cfg,
        reinit=True,
    )
    if cfg.model.model_type == "model1":
        for k in range(100):
            wandb.log({"squared": k**2})

    if cfg.model.model_type == "model2":
        factor = cfg.model.factor
        for k in range(100):
            wandb.log({"special": k**factor})

    wandb.finish()


if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()

```

The configuration directory is organised as follows:

```shell
minimal_conf
├── minimal_config.yaml
└── model
    ├── model1.yaml
    └── model2.yaml
```

with `model1.yaml`:
```yaml
model_type: "model1"
```

and `model2.yaml`:
```yaml
model_type: "model2"
# factor: 5
```
and `minimal_config.yaml`:

```yaml
defaults:
  - model: model1
```


The command line:

```shell
python neuralodev2/train/neuralode_2018/minimal_main.py -m model=model1,model2
```

works, since the failing configuration is specified last. In the dashboard we see indeed that the `model2` failed, as expected.

But the command line:

```shell
python neuralodev2/train/neuralode_2018/minimal_main.py -m model=model2,model1
```

fails. In the dashboard we see that the configuration `model2` finished, which is not what I expect.

What could the issue be ?

Thank you for any help :)
