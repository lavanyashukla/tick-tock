TITLE:
[CLI] AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'TorchGraph.create_forward_hook.<locals>.after_forward_hook'

BODY:
I am trying to save a model in PyTorch. I am using `wandb.watch()` on the model with `log_graph=True`
When I call `torch.save(model, PATH)`, I get the following error:

`AttributeError: Can't pickle local object 'TorchGraph.create_forward_hook.<locals>.after_forward_hook'`

This only happens when `log_graph=True`, so I believe it is about the wandb callback. Is there a way to remove the callback for saving?

I know that I can avoid this issue by saving `model.state_dict()` instead of the entire object, but I really do want to save the entire object for a number of reasons.
