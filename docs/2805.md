**Description**
Hi, I'm trying to clean up synced runs using the command line `wandb sync --clean`. I have old runs that have synced to the web app and finished more than 24 hours ago. However, I'm getting the message "No runs older than 24 hours found". Any ideas?

**Wandb features**
`wandb sync --clean`

**How to reproduce**
1. Saved wandb runs in custom folder, (setting `dir` keyword in `wandb.init`).
2. Navigate to folder containing wandb `run-...` folders.
3. Execute command `wandb sync --clean ${pwd}`
4. Error message is produced.

**Environment**
- OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9
- Environment: n/a
- Python Version: 3.8.2
