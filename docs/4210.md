TITLE:
[Feature]: Removing dashes in args passed to a local container

LABEL:
feature_request,c:launch

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

Hello,
I started to use the _launch_ feature. But every argument is automatically prepended with dashes. Which is fine if the user uses `argparse`, however it's not compatible with `hydra-core`.



### Suggested Solution

Currently, prepending dashes is baked in the source code. I would add some option, so the args would not be prepended with dashes.

### Alternatives

Another alternative might be removing the dashes addition entirely.

### Additional Context
