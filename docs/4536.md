### Description

Hi,

In the wandb UI, we can see the sweeps created for a particular project in sweeps page. And we can delete a particular sweep from the UI. I want to programmatically delete a particular sweep and all associated runs, artifacts.

This will help in deleting unwanted sweeps which are created in the experimentation process 

### Suggested Solution

delete using following methods:

CLI : wandb sweep --delete SWEEP_ID

and/or 

Python:
delete method on wandb.apis.public.Sweep class
Ex. sweep.delete()
