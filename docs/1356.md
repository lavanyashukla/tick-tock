TITLE:
How to specify project for "wandb sync"?

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I accidentally ran some experiments in dryrun mode, and would like to sync them online. I have a few projects (A, B, C) and ran my experiments in project B. However, when I run "wandb sync", they are sent to project A in the web interface. How can I specify that I want them to sync to project B instead?

Note: in the web interface I can move runs from one project to another, which solves this to some extent, but I just wanted to know if it's possible to do this in `wandb sync` in the first place.
