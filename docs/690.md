TITLE:
%%wandb not loaded before calling wandb.init() at least once

The jupyter wandb magic does not work until `wandb.init()` was at least called once.
I have the following setup:

```
%%wandb
train_model()   # <-- calls wandb.init()
```

This gives the error:
```
UsageError: Cell magic `%%wandb` not found.
```

Loading the extension explicitly with `%load_ext wandb` did not help either.
Is there a way to load the magic without creating a new run?
