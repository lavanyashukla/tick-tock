TITLE:
[CLI]: problem with removing the callback in `fastai`

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
## Environment: In Google Colab
I have a training routine in `fastai` with a `wandb` callback to log the training. Once the training is finished, I remove the callback and then export the model.

Then in a separate notebook, I load the model and use it for inference, and everything works as expected

## Environment: Compute Cluster (with SLURM)

When I use that same training routine in SLURM, remove the callback and then export the model, then during inference, the model starts a log in the `wandb` project. Which is surprising as this behavior is not expected.

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
dls = ImageDataLoaders(...)
learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet50, cbs=[WandbCallback()])
learn.fine_tune(10)
learn.remove_cb(WandbCallback)
learn.export('foo.pkl')
wandb.finish()
```

```py
Currently running fastai_multi_label_predict_DNV.py with test_0 image_csvs
