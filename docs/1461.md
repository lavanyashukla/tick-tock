TITLE:
wandb python not syncing when tensboard logging to s3

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I'm only getting learning rate information logged when using wandb with tensorboard, when I'm logging to an s3 bucket. I'm not getting any of my metrics or losses.

I'm running an EC2 ubuntu 18.04 deep learning instance with TF 2.3.1 and wandb 0.10.8. Works fine when I log locally.
