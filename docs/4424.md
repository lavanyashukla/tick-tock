### Describe the bug

Hi, 
I was syncing my experiment normally with the command `wandb sync name`. This worked for tens of experiments.
Suddenly, an hour ago, this command stopped working, and I'm getting the following error:
```bash
wandb sync experiment_xxx
wandb: Network error (ReadTimeout), entering retry loop.
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: internal database error (<Response [500]>)
```
I do not have a network connection problem. In fact, I tried to sync from a different computer and it's not working.

I checked my account, everything seems ok. Mentioning the project or the experiment id in the command `--id` does not help either.

How can I address this issue?

Thank you in advance!
