### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
We are trying to create an additional run after an agent is done running a sweep. However, what we observe is that the additional run appends its logged data to the last run in the sweep. 

We reproduced this issue starting from the code snippet in https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/agent which describes how to use ```wandb.agent```. 

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
import wandb
sweep_configuration = {
    "name": "my-awesome-sweep",
    "metric": {"name": "accuracy", "goal": "maximize"},
    "method": "grid",
    "parameters": {
        "a": {
            "values": [1, 2, 3, 4]
        }
    }
}

def my_train_func():
    # read the current value of parameter "a" from wandb.config
    wandb.init()
    print(wandb.run.id)
    a = wandb.config.a

    wandb.log({"a": a, "accuracy": a + 1})

sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep_configuration)

# run the sweep
wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=my_train_func)

print(wandb.run) # prints None as expected

## modification to https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/agent starts here
run2 = wandb.init(reinit=True, name="Test")
wandb.log({"test_data": 20})
print(wandb.run.id)
```

This returns the following output:

In which, as you can see, the very last run appends its logged data to the last run of the sweep - the URLs and IDs are the very same. The name of the run in the web API also gets changed. 

From what we gathered from the API docs, the ```reinit``` parameter in ```wandb.init()``` should handle our case fine. However, this is not the behavior we observe and we even get a warning that we cannot change the session parameters because one is already open.
