TITLE:
Issue with logging multiple confusion matricies

### Description

I'm trying to log a confusion matrix after each epoch using 
`wandb.sklearn.plot_confusion_matrix(all_predictions, all_labels, class_labels,
                                            title=f'Confusion Matrix: Epoch {epoch}', normalize=True)`. 

My expected behaviour would be multiple confusion matrices getting logged each with the appropriate title, but the actual result (shown below), is that the original matrix gets overwritten and the individual values end up written on top of each other.
