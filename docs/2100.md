TITLE:
[Q] How to deal with frequent network error (ReadTimeout)

BODY:
I started to use wandb on a cluster one month ago and it worked pretty well until recently. I usually launch multiple jobs to the cluster simultaneously, and some of them will 'crash' in the middle of training.

Exception in thread Thread-5:

wandb: Network error (ReadTimeout), entering retry loop. See wandb/debug-internal.log for full traceback.
wandb: Network error resolved after 0:01:05.390972, resuming normal operation.
```

Although the program is still running and the log suggests that it has resumed to normal operation, the status of that job is still "crashed" on the dashboard. I know I can use `wandb sync run_dir`  to manually sync each disconnected run, but is there any method that wandb can reconnect by itself?

Also, what might be the possible reasons for the internet error? Multiple wandb programs on a single machine?

Thanks!
