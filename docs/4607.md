### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
Firstly I ran
```python
run = wandb.init(project='proj_name', 
                         config={k:v for k, v in dict(vars(CFG)).items() if '__' not in k},
                         anonymous=anonymous,
                         name="fold_f_str",
                         group=CFG.comment,
                        )
```
and getting 
```shell
...
You can sync this run to the cloud by running:
wandb sync {rund_folder_absolute_path}
...
```

And when I tring to do it 

```shell
raise CommError("Invalid or missing api_key. Run `wandb login`")
wandb.errors.CommError: Invalid or missing api_key. Run `wandb login`
```

Ok lets login:
```python
wandb.login(my_wandb_api_key)
```
```shell
wandb: WARNING Calling wandb.login() after wandb.init() has no effect.
True
```

But afterwards the result of sync is still the same.

Is there a way to sync using py API? Is there a way to use CLI api from jupyter properly?
Why "You can sync this run to the cloud by running:
wandb sync {rund_folder_absolute_path}" is not describing all of this steps?

https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/cli/wandb-sync?q=sync
seem to not have answer for this usage case,
