Hey hey\!

Apologies, I had a colleague breathing down my neck when I messaged you ðŸ™‚

hey, quick feature query: it would be great if I have report, and I could name some of my runs so they show under the name of "cool experiment from Filip" on the graph, rather than "some_tag:123"

right now I can do that if I don't do any grouping (I can just name experiment)

but if I do some grouping, I can't do that anymore

This is how my report looks right now - it's cool, I can have nice labels and everything. However, once I run a couple of seeds for each of these experiments, and I want to match them using a tag...

This looks ugly, and I can't rename these groups afterwards. Especially in the reports feature, it would be nice to be able to rename it so that you can share findings with someone easier

Thanks ðŸ™‚

Filip
