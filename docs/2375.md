TITLE:
[CLI] wandb sync command line issues

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
2 options seem to have issues as described below
1. `wandb sync --include-globs <globs>` seemed to miss one folder which was synced when I simply used the command `wandb sync <globs>` (when the glob)
2. `wandb sync --no-include-synced` does not seem to have an effect and re-syncs all folders (going by the message saying "Syncing : <run_url> ...done")

**Wandb features**
command line `wandb sync`

**Environment**
- OS: [Mac OS 11.4]
