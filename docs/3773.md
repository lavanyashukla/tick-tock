TITLE:
[App]: Abnormal Behavior when writing a report using Korean input methods

LABEL:
app

STATE:
closed

BODY:
### Current Behavior

I think this is an extension of #3525, the abnormal behavior happening to Korean characters along with Chinese and Japanese.
When trying to type in Korean (using MacOS Monterey) on the report page, the following abnormal behaviors happen:
1. Location of the cursor will suddenly change to different places on the line
2. The characters will be duplicated erratically

### Expected Behavior

I had no problem writing Korean in the description section and expected it to behave the same for the main part of the report.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to create a new report
2. Type in the main part of report in Korean
