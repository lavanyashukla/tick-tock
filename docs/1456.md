In the table representation of a model on the Model tab in Run web-interface, values in Type and #Parameters columns are cut and not fully visible (at least when a simple table view of the model is used).

Sometimes I need to refer to some specific settings in the model definition used in a run, and this Tab could be very useful.. when the visibility is fixed =)
