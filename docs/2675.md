The questions pretty much sums up the issue.

In my training script I train a classifier multiple times. I would like to be able to make new graphs under the same metric every time I train a classifier from scratch. [Example of my Issue](https://wandb.ai/mvalente/Zero_Flow_CUB/reports/Shared-panel-21-09-16-18-09-00--VmlldzoxMDI5Mzky?highlightShare) .

[What I would like to happen](https://wandb.ai/mvalente/toy_data_zf/reports/Shared-panel-21-09-16-18-09-04--VmlldzoxMDI5Mzk2?highlightShare) Some sort of slider or anything that achieves the same functionality to have the graphs separated.

Thx in advance!
