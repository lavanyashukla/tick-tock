### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

I have set up a GCP VM instance and the wandb login seems fine (the key appears in the `~/.netrc/, etc.).
```
❯ wandb login
wandb: W&B API key is configured. Use `wandb login --relogin` to force relogin
```
I've also used this setup in other GCP projects with no issues. However on this particular instance, I'm getting errors when I try to call `wandb.init`:

```
>>> wandb.__version__
'0.14.2'
>>> wandb.init(project="hippo")
wandb: W&B API key is configured. Use `wandb login --relogin` to force relogin
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: user is not logged in (<Response [401]>)

wandb: ERROR The API key is either invalid or missing, or the host is incorrect. To resolve this issue, you may try running the 'wandb login --host [hostname]' command. The host defaults to 'https://api.wandb.ai' if not specified. (Error 401: Unauthorized)

```

I did some searching around on the internet and in the wandb issues/discussions and can't see any information about this.
