### Description

Hello, when I try to run a sweep with a model built with Pytorch lightning it always hangs. It never runs even the first configuration.  

### What I Did

a minimal working example is in this notebook: [https://github.com/AyushExel/COVID19WB/blob/master/main.ipynb](https://github.com/AyushExel/COVID19WB/blob/master/main.ipynb
)  
For the author it seems to work but I log on with my wandb account it just hangs:

Any help would be appreciated.  
Thanks
