Log to closed run [Q]

Hi there,
I am new to the framework and could not find an answer to my fairly basic question so far:

Is there a possibility to log values to an already finished run? My use case is, that the training of a model was performed properly, but I had a bug in the test error evaluation at the end. Since I already have the training data, it would be nice if I could just manually log the test results to the already finished run.
