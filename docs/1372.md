TITLE:
overrride files with wandb.save

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
During training, we are saving a snapshot of the best model and upload the snapshot to wandb.

```python

if best:
   saveSnapshot("./snapshot.onnx")
   wandb.save("./snapshot.onnx")
```

However, only the first generated snapshot is available on wandb. I assume that wandb checks if this file already exists and does not overwrite it.

Is there any option to enable overriding?
