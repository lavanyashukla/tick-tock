TITLE:
[Q] Using wandb on SLURM

LABEL:

BODY:
Usually to use wandb on a machine/server the first step to do is to login ([wandb login](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart)). 
In cluster, as SLURM, we login in a node but the code will run on a different one; how should one proceed to login in wandb?

I read that the login in wandb can be performed by environment variable [WANDB_API_KEY](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/environment-variables).
In fact the description in the above link says: "Sets the authentication key associated with your account. This must be set if wandb login hasn't been run on the remote machine." which seems exatly my case.

I didn't understand exatly how to use (and where to put the environment variable (python code, slurm script..)). I tried to define the WANDB_API_KEY variable in the slurm script but this didn't work.
Can you explain how to proceed?
