TITLE:
[CLI]: wandb wrongly shows a run as crashed and stops logging

LABEL:

### Describe the bug

We pretrain large models with [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) and log progress with wandb. During the run wandb stops logging and the run is shown as crashed (even though the model is training just fine). This really hurts our ability to use wandb when pretraining such models, and we will appreciate help in solving this problem asap.

This is a link to the relevant run:

Thank you very much.
