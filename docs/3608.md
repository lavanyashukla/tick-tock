[CLI]: Delete runs without "y" prompt

### Describe the bug

I'm trying to delete synced runs locally using the `wandb sync --clean-force` command but am not using it correctly. I'm adding this to a cronjob so would like to bypass the "y/N" prompt. I've also attempted something like "yes | wandb sync --clean" but no luck there either. Can someone please advise?

```shell
$ wandb sync --clean-force
wandb: No runs to be synced.
wandb: NOTE: use wandb sync --clean to delete 135 synced runs from local directory.
```
Also:

```shell
$ wandb sync --clean
...
wandb/run-20220502_111640-1t8xl1my
wandb/run-20220502_112543-32tnpb94
wandb/run-20220502_115027-keg3ihgw
wandb/run-20220502_123327-1bzyp3lr
wandb/run-20220502_131555-3dyp1a12
Are you sure you want to remove 82 runs? [y/N]:
```

Why do I get different values (135 runs vs. 82 runs) depending on which command I run?

Thanks!
