TITLE:
[Q] Table column that checks for with empty values

BODY:
How do I add a computed column to a table that evaluates to true, if a field is empty? In my example, I'd like it to be true, if the column `gold_0_start` is empty. I've tried the following expressions but none of them seem to work:
- `row["gold_0_start"] = "-"`
- `row["gold_0_start"] = "null"`
- `row["gold_0_start"] = "None"`
- `row["gold_0_start"] != row["gold_0_start"]` (yeah, long shot)

Any suggestions on how I can achieve this? Thanks!
