### Description

Add an option to convert a bar plot into a simple table

An example:
I have a several groups of runs, all summarize in a bar plot - each bar plot is the average of some metric of the runs in the group.

I want to convert the bar plot into a simple table which contains the mean the std as shown in the bar plot.

This may useful for summarizing results for a paper (for a example).

### Suggested Solution

Add an option in the Bar plot chart:
"convert to table"
and a markdown panel with the table corresponded to the Bar plot will be created.

### Alternatives

_No response_

### Additional Context

An easy way to make runs from reports and wandb system into a scientific paper
