TITLE:
[CLI] Agents hanging up in Sweeps - Linux

LABEL:
cli,stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Description**
Sweep agent hangs up without throwing errors or traceback

**Wandb features**
`wandb.init()`, `wandb.watch()`, `wandb.log()`

**How to reproduce**
I am running two Sweeps on separate GPUs. The first Sweep is working well, but the other one is hanging for a few hours after 66 runs.

I read [#1197](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1197) and [#1168](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/1168) that in Jupyter and Google Colab, you have to move your imports to your train function to solve the problem, and I wanted to ask if it holds also for sweeps that are running in Docker. By moving imports, does it mean I have to put all my `import <LIBRARY>` inside my train function (i.e., `objective_sweep` below)?

Another thing that concerns me is both Sweeps are saving their metadata in `./wandb` directory. Would this be a problem here?

The codes I am using are:

```
import os
...
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import wandb

def objective_sweep(args, seed, device):
    # Initialize a new wandb run
    with wandb.init(config=None):
        config = wandb.config # if called by wandb.agent, this config will be set by the Sweep Controller
        ...
        # Train and Validate
        wandb.watch(model, log="all", log_freq=100)

        for epoch in range(start_epoch, args.epochs):

            print('\nEpoch: [%d | %d] LR: %f' % (epoch + 1, args.epochs, config.learning_rate))

            # Train and Validate Network Model
            train_loss, train_acc = train(model, trainloader, criterion, optimizer, epoch, device)
            test_loss, test_acc = test(model, testloader, criterion, device)

            # Log Model Behavior to W&B
            wandb.log({
                "train_loss": train_loss,
                "train_acc": train_acc,
                "test_loss": test_loss,
                "test_acc": test_acc,
                "best_acc": best_acc,
                "epoch": epoch
            })
       ...
       print('Best accuracy: {}'.format(best_acc))

    return None
```
```
# Configure Settings
study_name = os.path.basename(os.path.normpath(args.checkpoint))
entity_name = args.entity_name
sweep_config = create_sweep_config(args,study_name,verbose=True)
# Initialize Sweep: Wind Up the Sweep Controller
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep=sweep_config, project=study_name, entity=entity_name)
# Run Sweep Agent
wandb.agent(sweep_id, function=lambda: objective_sweep(args, seed=SEED, device=DEVICE), entity=entity_name, project=study_name, count=N_TRIAL)
```
