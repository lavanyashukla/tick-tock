TITLE:
[Feature]: Don't autocast config float values to int

### Description

Similar to #1421, I'm seeing that my config parameters which have values like `2.0` or `0.0` get casted to integers `2` or `0`. For config libraries that force types to match (I'm using YACS), this throws an error when this value is merged back into the config when resuming a run (it's expecting float but receives int). 

Can we maintain types in `wandb.init()` when passing in the config? Is there a workaround for now, other than storing and loading as strings which is clearly not ideal? 

Thanks!

### Suggested Solution

Maintain value types in config dictionary passed to `wandb.init()`.
