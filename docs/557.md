### Description
Trying to launch training code in pytorch.
Launching code as recommended with` wandb run python train.py`
I have a` wandb.init(...)` at the begining of my code.

This code works perfectly fine on linux.

### What I Did
Put all my code in a` if __name__ == "__main__"` because windows needs it to launch processes : No success

```
wandb run python train.py 

wandb: ERROR wandb.init hasn't been called, can't configure run
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "train.py", line 164, in <module>
    wandb.save(PATH_WEIGHTS_EMBEDDER)
  File "C:\Users\pisne\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\wandb\__init__.py", line 493, in save
    os.symlink(abs_path, wandb_path)
OSError: symbolic link privilege not held
wandb: Program failed with code 1. Press ctrl-c to abort syncing.
