Hello, 

I am training a model on a remote server and I got this error after running on the terminal `wandb login` and running the training script itself. 

```
wandb: Tracking run with wandb version 0.8.15
wandb: Run data is saved locally in wandb/run-20191107_074736-rjih2419

Do you have an idea how to solve this please ?
