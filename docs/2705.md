TITLE:
Image upload for nested metric not working[App] 

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
I want to log a list of images in a nested dictionary i.e. {'triain': {'images': image_list}}, however when I go to the app I get the message:
`'This run didn't log images for key 'train.image' step 0 index 0`
Note that the images do exist in the app folder: Files/media/images/image_list_x_y


**To Reproduce**
Code:
```
import wandb
import torch
wandb.login()
run = wandb.init(project= "MyProject", name= "wandb images")
im = torch.rand(3,40,40)
im_list = [wandb.Image(im), wandb.Image(im)]
im_dict = {'images': im_list}

run.log({'Image_list': im_list,
         'Image_dict': im_dict,
         })
run.finish()
```

In App:
1. Go to 'wandb images'
2. Scroll down to 'Media'
3. See error under 'Image_dict.Nested_im_list' but not under 'image_list'

**Expected behavior**
I expected to be able to see both sets of images.

**Operating System**
 - OS: Windows

 - Version 0.12.2

**Notes**
First time I am posting so do let me know if I could have done something more clear or in a different way.
