TITLE:
[App] Plotly from seaborn violinplot looks nothing like the original

LABEL:

**Describe the bug**
I have a graph that I regrettably cannot show in a public forum, but it's a dual-series violin plot from [seaborn (on top of matplotlib)](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.violinplot.html?highlight=boxplot).

The resultant in wandb not only looks nothing like the original plot, but it's also not tracking the series correctly. I have two series of data, but they are the same color in the wandb interface and there is no indication of which series is which, making the plot almost useless unfortunately.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a simple violin plot with the examples in the link above
2. Log to wandb using something like below:
```
fig, _ = plt.subplots(figsize=[16, 9])
sns.violinplot(
    data=df, y='value', x=key, hue='variable',
    inner="quartile"
)
trainer.logger.experiment.log({
    "Title": fig,
    "global_step": trainer.global_step
}, commit=False)
```
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
I expect some differences because they're different chart libraries, but the chart produced isn't keeping track of the important data so I can't really use it. I'd like to avoid uploading images for these as (1) Images take longer to upload in high-res, and (2) I'd like to be able to have these vectorized.

**Additional context**
The legend for this data also appears to have just been rendered as a box of text and doesn't indicate any color information.
