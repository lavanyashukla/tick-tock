[Q]How to start wandb locally on a Redhat with podman instead of docker

LABEL:

Hi,

Because the Docker is not supported by RedHat 8, the Podman is installed instead. I can pull the latest Docker, run the container, and log in at http://X.X.X.X/:8080/ 

However, the Wandb can not be started locally. After 'wandb local' command,  I get this 'Error: Docker not installed, install it from https://docker.com'

I also try this, wandb login --host=http://X.X.X.X/:8080/,  and paste the API key, but get another error:
wandb: ERROR Host must be a url in the form https://some.address.com

Could you give me any hint to solve this problem?
