[CLI]: sync offline-run artifacts get duplicated on web-server

### Describe the bug

When syncing an offline run to the web via the `sync` command, the artifacts get duplicated.

In my code I have a loop logging each time a table artifact:
```python
wandb.log({'table': table = wandb.Table(...})
```
When I use an online run I get the *wanted* output of a table with versions (each representing a loop iteration) as follows:

In this example, the loop performed the python code above 8 times creating versions 0-7.

The problem starts when I train it with `WANDB_MODE=offline` and then run the following command: 
```shell
wandb sync offline-run-<run-id>
```
The first time it will work correctly and will upload all versions up to the current loop status (lets say versions 0-2),
when the loop will continue, if I'll run the command again, instead of uploading versions 3-7, it will upload 0-2 again and start the counting from version 3, ending up with versions 0-10, where versions 0-2 are the same as versions 3-5.
