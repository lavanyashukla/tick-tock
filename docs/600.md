 I think I’ve hit a bug in the windows version by the way, pretty small but should be easy to reproduce:

Start a run “wandb run python main.py”
Cancel the run (“ctrl-c”)
Cancel the sync (“ctrl-c”)
Wandb hangs
Pretty easy to avoid but for someone who mashes ctrl-c when I find an issue this is a bit annoying.
