### Description

I enjoy using W&B as it makes experiment tracking is so much better. 
A feature I really really want to use a lot is **Reports**. However, I have faced way too much friction, stated below, to properly use it. Assuming others have also faced similar issues, resolving them would greatly be beneficial to the community.

#### Good to Have Features (or Currently too much effort/friction):
1. Currently exporting a section from the UI Workspace creates a new report. This has led to me creating tens of report instead of 1. Having everything in 1 report helps build a story & progression of experiments. Also, there seems to be no way to copy sections from one report to another.

2. Similar to the above issue when exporting sections, there seems no way to simply check the runs you want to export instead of exporting all runs & then filtering & selecting the runs in the report.

These issues make using reports too much of a time sink. I believe reports have the potential to be awesome & act as blogs or experiments/analysis/results sections of WIP paper/projects.

@lavanyashukla & @sayakpaul have created quite a few awesome blog-ish reports. Perhaps they might have also faced similar issues and/or found workarounds.
If there are any quick & easy workarounds these issues, I'd be glad to discover them.
