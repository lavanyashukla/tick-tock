TITLE:
[App]: Custom chart shows "no data available", 

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Current Behavior

Custom Plot writes "No data available", see screenshot below

### Expected Behavior

I expected for custom plot to draw the plot.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Set up local wandb
2. 
```
import wandb
wandb.init(project="ProjectExample")
table = wandb.Table(data=[(x, x ** 2) for x in range(1, 10)], columns = ["x", "y"])
wandb.log({"NativePlotExample" : wandb.plot.line(table, "x", "y", title="Custom Y vs X Line Plot")})
wandb.finish()
```


I'm not sure this behaviour is reproducible, I had troubles with installing wandb-local and at my first iteration this plot worked but server stopped working and when I restarted the server and created this plot again, everything was fine except this plot that stopped drawing. 

### Screenshots

You can clearly see where the bug is in a response:
```
message: "objconv/json: expected token but found '<'"
path: ["runSets", 0, "summaryTable"]
```

But http query does not contain '<':
```
operationName: null
query: "{\n  runSets(runSets: [{entityName: \"demo_iser\", projectName: \"ProjectExample\", filters: \"{\\\"$and\\\":[{\\\"$or\\\":[{\\\"$and\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"2j5abltc\\\"}]}]},{\\\"$and\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":{\\\"$ne\\\":null}}]}]}\", order: \"+createdAt\", grouping: []}], limit: 500) {\n    id\n    name\n    _defaultColorIndex\n    summaryTable(tableKey: \"NativePlotExample_table\", tableColumns: [\"y\", \"x\"])\n    _defaultColorIndex1: _defaultColorIndex\n    __typename\n  }\n}\n"
variables: {}
```

### Environment

OS:
Fedora 33 (Container Image)
Browsers:
Google Chrome
Version:
wandb==0.13.4

### Additional Context

The same mistake can be found in earlier issue: https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/2051.
But sumple change from summaryTable to historyTable does not help. The bug is seemingly is in something else, probably in objconv/json generation.
