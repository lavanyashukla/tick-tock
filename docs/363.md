TITLE:
Feature request: An easy and intuitive way to edit projects and delete empty projects.

LABEL:
enhancement

STATE:
closed

BODY:
When using the online dashboard, I haven't found a way to edit projects (change their name, description, privacy level). Let me know if it exists and I just haven't found it. But this would be a nice feature to have.

Also, there is an option to delete a project by using the menu in the top right of the project page, but when the project is empty, that menu button isn't displayed. It would be nice to be able to delete an empty project. Perhaps this menu button could remain visible even when the project is empty.
