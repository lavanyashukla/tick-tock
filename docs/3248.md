What is the proper way to save model checkpoints from one run?

I`ve tried to save in one Artifact obejct, 

`snapshot_artifact = wandb.Artifact(name=wandb.run.id, type='model')`
`snapshot_artifact.add_file(os.path.join(wandb.run.dir, 'snapshots', latest_snapshot), os.path.join('snapshots', latest_snapshot)) `
`wandb.run.log_artifact(snapshot_artifact)`

but  `ValueError: Can't add to finalized artifact` when I try to save checkpoint in second time. (Problem is in `finalize` in log_artifacts and the way to disable `.finalize()` is might be decision of my problem)  

I have no found the clear way in documentation to organize model checkpoints from one run in one folder. 

Structure I want is:
```
run_id
│   
└─── checkpoints
          │─ checkpoint_000100.pt 
          │─ checkpoint_000200.pt
```
