Stopping a run from the Wandb UI doesn't work in Docker

### Description

I would like to stop a run from the Wandb UI, where there is an option to "stop run" on the run overview page. This works for experiments started from the command line. But when I have an experiment running in a docker container, it doesn't work.

I have started an experiment in the container with something like (kubernetes-config-style):
```
command: [ "/bin/bash", "-c", "--" ]
args:
 - "cd /my_code && python3 -m my_experiment_module"
```

When I hit the "stop run" button, I don't see any output in the container logs - it just keeps running like nothing happened.

I know a common issue with docker containers is that you'll send a signal to the container, but it'll get eaten by bash and not passed on to your program. But here it doesn't seem like that would be the issue.
