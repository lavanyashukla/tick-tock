No file extension when downloading files from artifacts web-interface

### Description

When I try to download a file from artifacts web-interface to my computer, it gets loaded with some hash instead of a name with no file extension, e.g. "dc9067a141a0788057af18ba7033cb39". 
This means that I need to do an extra step to rename the file in order to open it (kind of annoying).

Screenshot with the download button clicked:

I suspect the issue is related purely with the downloading from web:
* I can see that all files are uploaded with correct names and that files extensions are correctly recognized, e.g. Netron launches when I try to view .pth file in web-interface.
* I don't have any problem with filenames when downloading with Python API
