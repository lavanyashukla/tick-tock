SOCKS5 Proxy Support

Hi!

I'm trying to use wandb on a cluster where I don't have Internet access. I usually solve this by creating a socks5 proxy through ssh tunelling. 

I did the same thing now (i.e. ssh -R 9999 host), and then setting the https_proxy environment variable to `socks5://localhost:9999`. Unfortunately, the error I'm getting is that 

```
urllib3.exceptions.ProxySchemeUnknown: Proxy URL had unsupported scheme socks5, should use http:// or https://
```
I have also tried https:// and http:// instead of socks5:// but those don't work because there is no proxy on that protocol running.

Does wandb not have socks5 support? If so, is there any other way I could hack around this? Any advice is welcome, I would really love to use wandb for this project.

Thank you!
Alex
