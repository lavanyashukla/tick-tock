TPU utilization with support for torch-xla

BODY:
Would be nice to be able to see TPU utilization on W&B.

I'm now using Google's `capture_tpu_profile` by ssh:ing to the main VM and running it there.

The output seems to be just byte strings to stdout, so it should be fairly simple to catch that.
