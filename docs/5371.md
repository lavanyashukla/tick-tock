[Q] Multi-node & multi-GPU hyperparameter tuning in sweep

Hi,
I'm a new learner of W&B.
I tried to use wandb.agent() to tune hyperparameters in multi GPUs and nodes.
I found that if I run multiple agents with the CUDA environment variable, then I can use sweep platform in multi GPU.
Like below
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 wandb agent 'sweep-ID'
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 wandb agent 'sweep-ID'

But if I have multiple GPUs in multiple nodes, I cannot use CUDA environment variable.
How can I use sweep platform in multi nodes & multi GPUs environment?
