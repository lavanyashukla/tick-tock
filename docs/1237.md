### Description

Using the hyperband early termination criterion for sweeps, you must specify where the "bands" are, which is how many iterations of the objective metric get reported before the algorithm considers whether or not to stop the run.  They are an exponential series like 2,4,8,16, etc.

### What I Did

If you configure the bands like:

```
early_terminate:
    type: hyperband
    min_iter: 2
    eta: 2
```

Here, the bands should be configured for iterations 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.  But instead of considering the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 16th metric reported, it considers the 3rd, 5th, 9th, 17th, etc.  This is because the code takes the human-specified iteration numbers which are 1-based (e.g. "1" means the first iteration) and uses them as indexes into a python list, which is 0-based.
