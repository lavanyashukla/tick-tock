[CLI] When run sweep on my python code, entity and project is not loaded from config

**Description**
When I wanted to run sweep on my Python code, wandb.sweep() didn't parse both `entity` and `project` values neither in my yaml file nor in config dictionary. And finally, its project became `uncategorized`.
[The document](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/configuration#structure-of-the-sweep-configuration) said that we can set `entity` and `project` in a configuration, so wandb.sweep() method also should parse the values.

**Wandb features**
wandb.sweep()

**Environment**
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04
- Environment: Local (Both using Python directory and Poetry)
- Python Version: 3.9.0
