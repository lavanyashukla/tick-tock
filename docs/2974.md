**Description**
While training a model in pytorch-lightning 1.5+, wandb logs all unnecessary internal metrics. ![wandb bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44573741/144189632-f741ebd3-ce86-4fb6-bcf6-8c1b7d4d7658.JPG) .
I used pytorch-lightning 1.4.9 with wandb logger and did not encounter this issue. One this to note, the unnecessary metrics suddenly appears in the wandb dashboard after 10 minutes of starting the training. 

**How to reproduce**
Just use the boilerplate code for wandb logger with pytorch lightning.


**Environment**
- OS: Linux-5.4.104+-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic
