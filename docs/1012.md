### Description
I'm querying a `Run` object's history, using `run.history()`. 
With the `keys` argument set to `None`, it returns a dataframe with all the metrics as columns. When I set the `keys` argument to a list of strings, all of which are valid metric names, it returns a pandas Series of dictionaries instead. It feels like this should instead return a dataframe, just with a subset of columns. Is there a reason for the discrepancy?
