[Q] How to use `wandb sync --exclude-globs` properly?

BODY:
Hi, I want to exclude some large files, such as `*.pt`, when uploading an offline training directory to W&B. I've tried the command lines `wandb sync --exclude-globs \*.pt offline-run-xxx` and `wandb sync --exclude-globs "*.pt" offline-run-xxx`,  but they doesn't seem to work. May I ask how to use the `--exclude-globs` option properly?
