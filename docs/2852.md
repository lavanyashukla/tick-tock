[CLI] Attempting to load saved data deleted my model's config and summary

**Description**
I was attempting to load a saved checkpoint from a completed run. I called the following:

api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("{}/{}/{}".format(entity, project, run_id))
epoch = run.summary.epoch
wandb.init(project=project, entity=entity, id=run_id)
checkpoint_path = wandb.restore('checkpoints/checkpoint_{}.pt'.format(epoch)).name
checkpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path)
wandb.finish()

I got a timeout error, so I interrupted the code. 

Now my config and summary for this run are blank. **It deleted my config and summary**.

This is a huge bummer...this run was important and now critical data is lost. 

I ran this exact code before with no issues. I did recently upgrade to the latest wandb version, so maybe something has changed.

A few questions:

1. Why did this happen?
2. Can I recover my lost data? <- **of particular interest to me...**


**Environment**
- OS: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LT
- Environment: Python
- Python Version: 3.9.2
