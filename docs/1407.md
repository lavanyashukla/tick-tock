wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: conflict detected for file digest <random number here>, rebase required (<Response [409]>)

Hi all,

I've been seeing this warning numerous times while running experiments, but haven't been able to find any documentation of it occurring elsewhere. It doesn't crash the run, but I am concerned about potentially missed silent errors. 

I feel like it could have something to do with conflicts from other runs, but as far as I can tell everything is fairly well separated by directory upon any new run. Any insight on this?

P.S. I'd give a minimal example to reproduce it, but at this point it's far too unclear to me what is actually causing it in order to be able to extract the key code.

Thanks in advance!
