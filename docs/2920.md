TITLE:
[Q] How do I log a list of values only obtained at specific epochs?

Consider the following snippet:
```
for epoch in range(total_epochs):
    losses = []
    for step in range(total_steps):
        loss = get_loss()
        losses.append(loss)
    wandb.log({'loss': np.mean(losses)}, step=epoch)
    if epoch == 10:
        for li, ls in enumerate(losses):
            wandb.log({'loss_10': ls}. step=li)
```
Executing this gives a warning: `wandb: WARNING Step must only increase in log calls.` How do I get around this?
