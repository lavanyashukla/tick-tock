Problems loggin data with sweep

Hello
I'm working with wandb in the optimization of a network and since I updated to the last version I found some problems with the sweep that I didn't find before. 
My code runs like this:
```
for train_index, test_index in kf.split(dataset_train):
     run = wandb.init(project="3d-deep", group=group_id, job_type="training", reinit=True)
     wandb.config.update(args)
     F1_result = train(args, model, run, optimizer, dataloader_train, dataloader_val) #Train loop with run.log items
     F1_record.append(F1_result)
     run.finish()

run = wandb.init(project="3d-deep", group=group_id, job_type="eval")
F1_record = np.array(F1_record)
F1_mean = np.mean(F1_record)
F1_max = np.max(F1_record)
run.log({"Val/F1_mean": F1_mean,
              "Val/F1_max": F1_max}, step=0)
```

The thing is that if I launch the code without a sweep works fine and all the folds are logged as a different run but grouped by, and the F1_max and F1_mean are logged too. However, if I create a sweep from the web console of my project the runs don't group each other and overwrite the previous ones in the graph and the F1_mean and F1_max values don't appear anywhere. That didn't happen in previous versions where the method to use was wandb.join() instead of run.finish() . Also, as a minor problem, the steps in my graphs are not rounded numbers despite the step that I'm passing to the log function is the epoch, that is an integer. 

Please, can you help me with this?
