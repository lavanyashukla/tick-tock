**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
When adding a directory to an artifact, it finishes very quickly, e.g.:
`wandb: Adding directory to artifact (./../data/COCO/annotations)... Done. 2.5s`
However, then the files still need to be uploaded. This is not clear, and it is impossible to see how long it will take to finish.
`wandb: Waiting for W&B process to finish, PID 249... (success).`

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Add a progress indicator when uploading/syncing files.
