Hi everyone!

**Questions**
- Is it possible to train a model in a K-Fold set up with the [PyTorch Lightning Loop API](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensions/loops.html) and use [WANDB as logger](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pytorch_lightning.loggers.wandb.html)?
- How are the logs managed? What is logged in WANDB? How WANDB shows the results of the different folds?
- What about multi GPU/clusters in this scenario?
