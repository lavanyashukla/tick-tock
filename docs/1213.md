### Description

It seems that locally saved files and synchronized files in the cloud are separated, right? Deleting a run in W&B Dashboard will not automatically delete its corresponding local files and vice versa. And the command "$ wandb gc" only shows "no runs older than 24 hours found". 

Can anyone tell me how can delete runs both locally and remotely?

Besides, the locally saved directory has a name consist of "run-time-id". Can we simply define id as dir name?
