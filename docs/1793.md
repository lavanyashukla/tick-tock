TITLE:
[App] How to get sweep information for custom chart

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I am trying to create a box chart that displays several metrics for each of several sweeps. I see that I can access my metrics using `summary` or `history` keys. I also see that the query accesses ID and name info, although those fields do not seem to be editable. Is there a way to access info about which sweep each run belong to, if any? Thank you.
