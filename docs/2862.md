[CLI] wandb.plot.line_series xname is not working

**Description**
I think that "xname" parameter in [wandb.plot.line_series]  is not working properly.

**Wandb features**
wandb.plot.line_series()

**How to reproduce**
[Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16iHC4pI2uwoK84eNiVjpaNp-1P5a4aT5?usp=sharing)

If you put xname parameter, it maybe doesn't work properly.
I think this code is wrong.([Code Link](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/plot/line_series.py))
The code below is the fixed version.
`
return wandb.plot_table(
        "wandb/lineseries/v0",
        table,
        {"step": "step", "lineKey": "lineKey", "lineVal": "lineVal", "xname":xname or "x"},
        {"title": title}
    )
` 
I think that xname is in the fields, not in the string_fields.
I'm sorry if I made a mistake.
