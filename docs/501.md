TITLE:
Feature Request: Sweep configuration via python

LABEL:

Python 3.7.4

### Description

Currently hyperparameter sweeps are configured via sweep.yaml (https://docs.wandb.com/docs/sweep.html). It would be great if there were also a python interface for configuration and starting sweeps (passing a function to optimize).
