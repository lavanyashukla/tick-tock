TITLE:
[Feature] Image slider with iterations instead of step

LABEL:
feature_request,stale,app

STATE:
open

BODY:
**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to have the option to slide through my logged images using a custom slider (that depends on a the variable logged togheter with the image, in my case the total training iterations counter). Now it's only possible using the **step**.

**Additional context**
This would be usefull because different trainings end up logging the same image at a different **step** messing up the temporal alignment
