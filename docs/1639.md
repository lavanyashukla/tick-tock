TITLE:
watch() sometimes does not log the gradients

**Describe the bug**
I am training a generative adversarial network. Without adversarial training, the gradients of the generator is logged. With adversarial training, the gradients of the generator is not logged.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model
2. Add the following at [line 71](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model/blob/a15d4597ca189f9c4dfb43f7788cccbf8c41a7c3/run.py#L71) of `run.py`
```
wandb.watch(generator, log='all')
wandb.watch(discriminator, log='all')
wandb.watch(kp_detector, log='all')
```
3. Run `python run.py --config config/vox-256.yaml` and we can see the `generator` and `kp_detector` gradients are logged.
4. Run `python run.py --config config/vox-adv-256.yaml`, which is adversarial training, and we can see that only `discriminator` gradients are logged, not those of `generator` and `kp_detector`.

**Expected behavior**
The gradients of all the three network should be logged for adversarial training.
