TITLE:
[CLI]: Getting ConnectTimeout in offline mode when trying to log an image

LABEL:

### Describe the bug

I am running wandb in offline mode since I don’t have an internet connection on the compute nodes that I use for my experiments.
This works fine when I’m logging training loss and other things.
When I try to log images, however, I get the following warning wandb: `Network error (ConnectTimeout), entering retry loop.` and the run waits forever.

The logging happens through:
```python
images = []
for i in range(10):
    images.append(wandb.Image(image[i], caption=f"{caption}.{i}"))
wandb.log({category: images})
```
I can even see that the offline mode is active since I get the following output when I stop the run:
```shell
wandb: You can sync this run to the cloud by running:
wandb: wandb sync /scratch_emmy/outputs/wandb/offline-run-20230208_142336-9685bcf5ea8d5d35ccc9d93b2d035832
```

Maybe this is related to https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/2701 ?
