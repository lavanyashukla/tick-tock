[App]: Plots disappearing during run

### Current Behavior

My plots keep disappearing! All plots under "metrics/[name]" are gone for all my active runs. How frustrating to not know what any of my metrics are. I saw a similar bug about them disappearing once finished but for me it is the _active_ runs. Please make the reappear -- thanks!
