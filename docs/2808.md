TITLE:
[Q] where to find wandb/setting

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
I want to configure wandb so that it does not record the output.log (which I guess can save training time) and I think the way to do it is: https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/save-restore#how-do-i-ignore-files. But where can I find the wandb/setting to edit?
