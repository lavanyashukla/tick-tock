TITLE:
Unify STDOUT/STDERR logging

LABEL:

BODY:
STDOUT and STDERR are logged three separate ways, to the terminal, to the local `output.log`, and to the back end. Currently it's possible for the two streams to race differently in each case, resulting in slightly different output. We should make sure all three of these representations look exactly the same.
