TITLE:
[App]: Modal dialog to adjust visualisation panel filters very often does not work

LABEL:

STATE:
open

### Current Behavior

When I'm in the workspace view of a project and I am trying to edit a custom chart, it is possible to configure run filters in the "Query" part of the window. Very very frequently when I click on the drop-down button that has text like "3 filters", the modal dialog where I can adjust those filters fails to open, and the drop-down button just disappears. This is extremely frustrating because it literally stops me from being able to view my run results in a meaningful way until magically a few days later it might work again.

### Expected Behavior

The modal drop down dialog should always work and never crash/disappear.

### Steps To Reproduce

It is unclear what factors/deterministic steps make this happen, but it happens to me so often that just trying a few times on a few days should be enough to see it happen. Once it happens, it is totally consistent in happening every time and completely blocking me from being able to work. I think it tends to happen more on charts that you have to use the arrows to see (more than 12 charts or so).
