TITLE:
[Feature]: Use min/max metric value over all epochs on sweep

### Description

When running a sweep the value of each runs is the value of the metric after the run has completed.
However, in some cases (e.g. when training on synthetic data and evaluating on real data) the metric varies a lot over epochs, and therefore the last value is often not the best.

It would therefore be nice if you could set the metric goal to e.g. 'global_maximum' and 'global_minimum' such that a set of hyperparameters is evaluated based on the best metric reached throughout the run and not just the final value.

### Suggested Solution

When setting the metric goal to global_maximum the maximum value over all logged metrics is returned for the run.
Same with global_minimum
