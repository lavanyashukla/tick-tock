[CLI]: Histograms of single-item arrays are blank

### Describe the bug

It seems like histograms of single-item arrays don't work. I would expect them to display as a single line/bar at the value of that item, but instead in the WandB UI the histogram display is just blank. I think the data is recorded properly, because the axis bounds seem about right. And if I hover over the graph I see a tooltip that has some blue bars. So maybe this is a UI bug and not a client bug.

This happens for manually-recorded histograms, and also those generated by wandb.watch() (eg for a single-element PyTorch Parameter).

Let me know if you can't reproduce this and I can help.
