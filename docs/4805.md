[Q] Free up temporary space

BODY:
Is there a way to delete/clean temporary folders created by W&B to upload images to the W&B server?

I ran a couple of times into an out-of-space exception (OSError) on a shared machine.

Example for an experiment run with multiple executions:
```python
for _ in range(X):
    wandb.init(…, reinit=True)
    …
    # do training and logging
    wandb.log({"image": fig})
    …
    wandb.finish()
```
