[Q] How to store images as files and efficiently reference them in tables?

Hello,

I would like to save images into a directory so I have the raw images available locally (save the file locally then call `wandb.save()`), and then I would also like to log references to these images into tables (use `image = wandb.Image(filepath)` and `wandb.Table(image)`. I don't want the image data repeated / stored twice, since the images are relatively large (several MB each). I'm planning on storing a few hundred images per run.

Will this approach above avoid data being stored twice? I know I can use the API to extract the images from the table but I want to store the images as raw files for easier post-processing. 

Thanks!
