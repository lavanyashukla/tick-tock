### Current Behavior

I believe this is how the Americans do dates...

...and I respect their decision, but I am not American :)

It would be better if the code used the user's current locale. I believe [`Intl.DateTimeFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) has pretty wide support now.

Number-only formatting in general isn't great, since so many companies format dates in the locale of the (US) developer, us non-US folk are never quite sure when our locales are being used, so if you want to be clear and unambiguous, may I recommend formatting like "4 Jan 2023".
