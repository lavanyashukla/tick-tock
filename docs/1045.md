### Description

I'd like to visualize histograms. In your UI it's not possible to see much. The color idea across epochs is nice, but I'd appreciate to see more variants to pick the one that works best for the particular case. 
Tensorboard does that very nicely: https://jhui.github.io/2017/03/12/TensorBoard-visualize-your-learning/
An alternative could be to have a slider across epochs, like tensorboard does for images:
