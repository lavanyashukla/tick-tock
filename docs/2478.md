TITLE:
[Q] Plot multiple 'tables' from one run on one custom chart

Hi, 

I am logging multiple tables per run using wandb.Table(). Each table stores an array of floats. I then log them using wandb.log('Table A': wandb.plot.histogram(table_a), 'Table B': wandb.plot.histogram(table_b)).

I want to plot boxplots of these tables using the Vega functionality - but I want them on the same axis (all tables from each run across multiple runs). At the moment I can only plot the data across runs if the key is the same - so all 'Table A' data will populate on one chart and all 'Table B' data on a different chart. Can I plot Table A and Table B on the same axis?

Thanks
