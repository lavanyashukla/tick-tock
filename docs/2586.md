[Q] Wandb sweep: seeding previous runs

LABEL:

BODY:
Is there any criteria for seeding previous runs? I'm currently trying bayesian hyperparamters search for a dataset but I do have previous runs on different but similar dataset and the optimization is to be done with respect to accuracy similar to what was done previously. Accuracy metric for different datasets might be different. 

So, does seeding previous runs help in this case? 

Another question I would like to add is, could I run a sweep optimizing with respect to accuracy for different dataset, dataset being categorical value in sweep.yaml file. My concern is achievable accuracy might be different for different datasets. Would that work or do I need to create different sweeps for different dataset given that architecture is exactly same in all cases?
