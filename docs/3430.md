Wandb is a perfact tool for logging and visualizing! However I found that each run's folder in local machine consume much more disk than in wandb.ai cloud, for example:

I want to know why such a huge different in disk consumption and how can I clean local files(I just want to free more local disk space, and DO NOT want to delete them all, in order to save them as a local backup)
This really bothering me, I just consume ~5G in wandb.ai cloud, however more then 1T in local machine.
Can you help me?
