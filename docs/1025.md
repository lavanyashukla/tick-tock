### Description

I'm trying to manually sync the project, because for some reasons it does not sync it automatically.
I run `wandb sync path_to_the_project`, then in my terminal I see this window (attached), which I can't exit or do anything with it.
I've done it before using older versions and it worked fine.

### What I Did

```
wandb sync wandb/run-some-project
```
