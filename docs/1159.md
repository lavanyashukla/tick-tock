Passing allow_val_change=True to wandb.init() prevents sweeps from changing hyperparameters

I'm not sure if this is strictly a bug, but it's certainly not what I would expect.

* Weights and Biases version: 0.9.3
* Python version: 3.7.6
* Operating System: Linux

### Description

Passing `allow_val_change=True` to `wandb.init()` clamps the `config` values to their defaults when running a sweep, and thus no new values are used. The command line inputs introduced by `wandb` seem to be ignored.

### What I Did

I did the usual of defining `sweep.yaml`, running `wandb sweep sweep.yaml` and `wand agent <agent_id>`. In my `train.py` script, I print `wandb.config` after the `wandb.init()` call, which confirms that the hyperparameters in the sweep are always fixed to the defualt `config` values that I pass to `wandb.init()`. Setting `allow_val_change=False` prevents this unexpected behaviour.

I'd expect `allow_val_change` to simply allow me to overwrite `wandb.config` values in my training script, but still allow sweeps to run and modulate the hyperparameters.


P.S. Thank you very much for making this fantastic package; I'm finally emerging from my cave where I manually tune hyperparameters like a maniac.
