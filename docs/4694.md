[CLI]: Is the wandb server down?(Can't use wandb logger, can't use sweep)

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
`sweep` doesn't work properly, so does `wandb.log`. Is there something wrong with my machien or it's wandb? My other machine also has the same issue(`wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: internal database error (<Response [500]>)`).

And how should I use wandb if the server is down? Any help is appreciated!
<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
>>> import wandb
>>> wandb.init('hello')
```

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
500 response executing GraphQL.
{"error":"internal database error"}
500 response executing GraphQL.
{"error":"internal database error"}
wandb: W&B API key is configured. Use `wandb login --relogin` to force relogin
wandb: Network error (HTTPError), entering retry loop.
