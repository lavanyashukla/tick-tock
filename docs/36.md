TITLE:
Fix up API retry logic

LABEL:

BODY:
We now have util.request_with_retry that does somewhat smart retrying. We should probably use it everywhere, including instead of gql.Client which retries without backoff.

Later we'll refine our network issue handling design. For example if our servers go down we can still let the job finish by saving all files to local disk, then present them with "wandb servers seem to be down, this process will remain open until everything is ok and sync'd. Or you can ctrl-c this process and run 'wandb sync' at a later time to finish saving your data"
