TITLE:
sklearn plot_summary_metrics doesn't work on text

LABEL:

BODY:
I'm trying to use the sklearn plots on a text classification model (`HashingVectorizer` -> `LinearSVC`).

Unfortunately most are disallowed because of this assertion in `test_missing`:
https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/11ee41a3a95a9e3ab6cc69d1137377273c6bdbf6/wandb/sklearn/utils.py#L139

I'm sure some could still be used fine - `plot_summary_metrics` for example, only passes X_train/X_test through to the model, so it'd work fine with text problems:
https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/11ee41a3a95a9e3ab6cc69d1137377273c6bdbf6/wandb/sklearn/__init__.py#L224-L225
(Also the call to `model.predict_proba` is unused)

So a request to relax this condition on plots where relevant.

Thanks! :-)
