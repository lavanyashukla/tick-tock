### Description

I want to have two runs from two projects in one script. Is this supported, or do you have any viable alternatives for this?

This is different from [this commonly asked question](https://docs.wandb.com/library/init#how-do-i-launch-multiple-runs-from-one-script) in that I also want another run outside the loop.

### What I Did

```python
meta_run = wandb.init(project="meta")

for ... # Meta loop
    individual_run= wandb.init(project="individual")
    for ... # Training loop
        individual_run.log(...)
    individual_run.join()
    meta_run.log()
```
