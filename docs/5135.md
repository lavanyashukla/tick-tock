TITLE:
[Feature]: Add the ability to name models in wandb.watch

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

For now, the wandb.watch method only allows setting the model as nn.module, list or tuple. When watching several models (list or tuple) it is difficult to identify in the UI from which model the plot refers.

### Suggested Solution

Allow the user to pass the models as a dictionary, where the key represents the name of the model. In addition, we can add a parameter to pass the names as a list or tuple if the models are given in such format.
