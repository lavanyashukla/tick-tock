TITLE:
[Q] Run ongoing for 1 day 11h and counting - Progress bar for logging artifacts? 

LABEL:
c:artifacts

STATE:
open

BODY:
I'm currently updating my dataset artifact, which is a total of 260 GB - 150 GB of which is new. My run has been in progress for 1 day and 11 hours and is still running. Is there a way to see how much has been uploaded as a percentage, GBs, or anything like that? 

This is quite urgent, as my PC's RAM and Swp are all used (can't even use Chrome, and therefore obviously can't do any development) and I need to restart the PC to free them (have tried various CLI commands but they haven't worked). I'm debating on just stopping this run and setting up another PC to do it, as idle development time is very costly. 

Not sure if this is a question or feature request - apologies if I've used the wrong title. Hoping to get a response soon. Thank you for reading.
