TITLE:
Creating a confusion metric creates a custom chart without a title string

LABEL:
stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I created a confusion matrix with 20 different categorical labels, and than looked inside the custom charts section.

The relevant confusion matrix was there, but I did not see the label string that I gave for the confusion matrix there - https://ibb.co/5kXjmJr

This makes it hard to understand which confusion matrix relates to which label. In make case I log this matrix after every epoch, so I see many matrices without being able to identify them: https://ibb.co/94hLJ2T
