TITLE:
[Q] Docker args are not passed to a local container

LABEL:

BODY:
Where are not the docker arguments defined in _launch_ passed to a local container?

Specifically in `wandb/sdk/launch/agent/agent.py`:
```
def run_job(self, job: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    ...
    backend_config: Dict[str, Any] = {
            PROJECT_DOCKER_ARGS: {},
            PROJECT_SYNCHRONOUS: False,  # agent always runs async
        }
    ...
```

If I change the code according to the following snippet, it works.
```
def run_job(self, job: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    ...
    backend_config: Dict[str, Any] = {
            PROJECT_DOCKER_ARGS: launch_spec["docker"].get("args"),
            PROJECT_SYNCHRONOUS: False,  # agent always runs async
        }
    ...
```
