BODY:
Dear all, we have recently tried to run sweeps on local machines as well as on colab and encountered the following error:

With wandb version 0.10.30

```
500 response executing GraphQL.
{"errors":[{"message":"Invalid hyperparameter service response","path":["agentHeartbeat"]}],"data":{"agentHeartbeat":null}}

This interestingly occurs after all sweeps finished. This Error also seems to persist indefinetly such that the program (or cell in Colab) does not terminate. Is this an issue from our side since something in the 'client.py' appears to go wrong?
This errors occurs in another project as well which was previously working fine (about 3-4 days ago).
