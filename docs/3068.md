[App] Changing in curves when plotted multiple together

LABEL:

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
changing in charts (x ranges and curve's values) when more simulations are plotted together

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Prepare different simulation where the same quantity has been logged (there may be a difference in the logging time steps (x-axis values) for the different simulations)
2. Represent now the measure, with a plot, first taking a single simulation alone and then plotting simulations all together 
3.  The plots generated in the previous step looks different; 
so plotting more simulation on the same charts modify the single curves associated to each simulation

**Expected behavior**
I expect to see any difference between a curve plotted alone or with a second one

**Screenshots**
This screenshot are made from dummy curves just to show the phenomena.

The first two plot show the 2 simulations alone; note that in each time the plotted curve goes to 0 before the **x=10**.
When plottet toghether, instead, x-axis interval changes as also the sowed curve (in this case in fact curves go down to 0 afer **x=10**).
Finally if one reset the x interval to start from **x=1** as in the single simulation's plots (last picture)the plot doesn't show anything in the first part of the graph.
