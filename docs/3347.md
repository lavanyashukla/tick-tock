### Description

Hi,

Sorry if this question/request has been posted already but I could not find it anywhere. I noticed that when running : 

```
sweep = api.sweep("<entity>/<project>/<sweep_id>")
sweep_runs = sweep.runs
```

sweep_runs would ignore the runs that were added in the sweep with "configure prior runs". I then have to manually add the priorly configured runs which is a bit annoying.

It would be nice if there would be an option to return the prior runs as well.


Thanks a lot for this amazing tool !

### Suggested Solution

I would suggest to have an argument in api.sweep : 

`api.sweep("path",return_prior = False)`

Such that when return_prior = True, sweep.runs will contain the prior runs as well.
