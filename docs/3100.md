TITLE:
[App] Grouped runs cannot be sorted by name in both directions

LABEL:
stale,app

STATE:
open

BODY:
**Description**
When I group my runs by the field "Group" and sort my runs by the field "name", I expect that the group names are now sorted by names. This works fine when sorting the name in alphabetical order:

However, when I reverse the order in the sort tab, the ordering does not change:

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create multiple group of runs
2. Click on the "Group" button and select the field "group"
3. Click on the "Sort" button and select the field "name": The grouped runs should now be ordered alphabetically
4. Click on the arrow to reverse the ordering. In my case the ordering does not change

**Expected behavior**
I would like to see the reversed sort of my grouped runs.
