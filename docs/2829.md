TITLE:
[CLI] Metaflow integration requires torch, sklearn and pandas to be installed

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
**Description**
The Metaflow integration raises a NameError exception in this line if the torch library (referred by `nn.Module`) is not installed:

I suppose the same error will happen with the other method declarations with references to `nn.Module` and `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`.

If torch were a lightweight library I'd see no big problem, but it's a 800mb download which may not being used. Actually, the same applies to sklearn.

**Wandb features**
Metaflow integration.

**How to reproduce**
Just `import wandb.integration.metaflow` with no torch library installed.

**Environment**
- OS: Linux
- Environment: Miniconda
- Python Version: 3.8.5
- Fastcore version: 1.3.26
- wandb version: 0.12.5
