**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The tags feature is amazing - I always use them, and have many for my projects. But because they're so useful and I have so many of them, I find myself forgetting why I gave certain runs a specific tag. I end up having many runs, where colors are similar for completely different uses. For example, I have ~20 tags, but have not had any tag with a dark color yet (they're all pastel shades). 

Additionally, it would be great to be able to hide a group of tags (that have become irrelevant but we don't want to delete just incase)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great it we could change tag colors, add descriptions to tags, and hide groups of tags. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
