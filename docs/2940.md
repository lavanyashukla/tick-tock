TITLE:
[App] Limited number of prior runs for sweep.

BODY:
Hello, wandb team!

I tried to create a new sweep from existing runs, selected 36000 runs, in a window before creation it showed a correct number (screen attached), but after sweep creation only 1000 runs we showed as prior runs (another screen attached).

Is there a way to avoid this limitation?
Or this is just a bug?

Thank you in advance.
