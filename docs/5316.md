TITLE:
[Q] sweep define multiple commands

LABEL:

BODY:
I'm following this tutorial https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/define-sweep-configuration#command-
But in my case, I'm always loading config from a default yaml file. The currently listed options (e.g. argparse, hydra) all do not work for me, if I understand correctly. So I want to execute multiple commands by:

1. Load config from the default yaml file
2. Override the config values by the current sampled sweep's values
3. Write to a new yaml file
4. Run my program and load the newly written yaml file

Is there any easy way to do this?
