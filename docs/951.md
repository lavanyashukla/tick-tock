TITLE:
[Help] I can't finish any runs if my program is stiil running (even for none-wandb-related things).

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:

* Python version:  3.6.9
* Operating System: Linux

### Description

When I run many runs sequentially, I can see on the website that state of past runs keeps showing `running`, runtime keeps increasing too, and only when my program is stopped runs will show `finished`.

- Is that mean I am running many many runs simultaneously during the running of my program ?
  
- I want to shut down the run when I finish it.
- I want to see the true runtime of runs. 

### What I Did

```
import time
for _ in range(100):
  wandb.init(entity=<my username>, project='test', config={'param':233})
  wandb.log({'metric':332})
  wandb.join()
  time.sleep(10)
```
