[Q] How does parallel sweep work in the Bayesian search?

Hello,

I am running multiple `wandb agent`s on different GPUs to parallelize my Bayesian search as in [#597](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/597):

```
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0"
wandb.agent(sweep_id, entity=entity_name, project=project_name, count=N_TRIAL/n_gpu_count)
```

I had a question on how initiation of multiple agents works in the Bayesian search strategy, as it requires the results of previous sampling to decide the next hyperparameter values.

I know that a few other frameworks uses Constant Liar Algorithm or Thompson sampling to enable parallel Bayesian optimization, and I wanted to ask if there is a specific method used in W&B Sweeps. If so, can you refer to the code or paper used?

Thank you.
