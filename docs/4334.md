TITLE:
[Feature]: Quieter mode for wandb client logging

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

The wandb client currently prints a bunch of output at the end of a run. This unnecessarily pollutes logging systems.

Here's an example:

```

### Suggested Solution

I would like it to just print out the last 3 lines or so of that output. 

The many lines of `28.678 MB of 28.678 MB uploaded` should be removed - if it's not running in a terminal that supports line rewriting, please disable the progressbar feature.

And I'd like an option to turn off the summary logging.

### Alternatives

I think there's a "silent" mode already - but I don't want it to be silent, I just want it to be quieter. A few lines of output is acceptable, a few hundred is not.
