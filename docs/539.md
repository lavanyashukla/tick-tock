TITLE:
wandb fails on CUDA 8 and python3

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
* Weights and Biases version: 0.8.9 (according to pip)
* Python version: 3.7.1
* Operating System: linux

### Description

During any action with wandb, it fails on import (SyntaxError). This happens both in any script or any CLI action. We are running CUDA 8.0, and I guess `pynvml` that is being imported doesn't support python3.

Here's CUDA version:
```
> nvcc --version
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2016 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Tue_Jan_10_13:22:03_CST_2017
Cuda compilation tools, release 8.0, V8.0.61
```
 
Traceback on wandb import:
```

### Potential fix

I skimmed the code and the repo, it seems pynvml (Python bindings for NVIDIA Management Library) is used only in `meta.py` and `stats.py` to log used GPU stats and GPU count. A possible fix would be to wrap imports with try-catch + fail flag, or maybe an environment flag to skip that part entirely.

I can make a pull request over this weekend, but let me know if you have something else in mind.
