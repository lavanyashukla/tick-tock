TITLE:
[Feature]: Reset step option in wandb.init() which resets the step if required

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

Sometimes it is not possible to run wandb.log() only once and you need to run it more than once. In such a case, step continues in the next wandb.log() call. It will be a great feature if we can reset the step if the user requires it.

Thank you.

### Suggested Solution

something like 


```
for i in range(10):

    wandb.log(

    {'acc': (i*0.1)**2, 'epoch': i, 'batch': i+5}, step = i, **reset_step = True**)
```

feature will be very helpful.
