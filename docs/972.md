[Question] How to backfit missing config info into past runs

### Description

Often when beginning to track params and metrics for experiments, we end up with more variables/params to track than when we started.

How can I backfit config info (something we usually do via `wandb.config`) into my past runs?

I don't want to delete those runs and re-run the experiments but simply apply the static values they need to be set with so all my runs are consistent.

### What I Did

Nothing so far, apart from the start of this discussion.
