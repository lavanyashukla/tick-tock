TITLE:
[Feature] Early terminate gracefully

LABEL:
feature_request,c:sweeps,stale

STATE:
open

BODY:
Early terminating is an awesome feature but I'd like a way to, within my run, check if Wandb will early terminate so I can end gracefully (ie calculate my summary statistics). 

I'd like to have a way, say `wandb.run.early_terminate` which returns a boolean value representing whether the run will early terminate in the next step or something. 

An alternative would be to not use wandb's early terminate feature and do it myself but I'd enjoy this integration.
