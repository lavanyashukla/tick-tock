TensorBoard not syncing with wandb

**Describe the bug**
Tensorboard is not being synced with wandb, even when specifying `wandb.init(sync_tensorboard=True)`

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Initialize wandb: `wandb.init(sync_tensorboard=True)`
2. Log to tensorboard using `tf.summary.scalar()`

Simple TensorFlow training script to reproduce this manner:
https://gist.github.com/sff1019/8870a9e15e95b9e469cd3419b7891c2e

**Expected behavior**
It was expected to log metrics by syncing TensorBoard (Followed the directions as shown here: https://docs.wandb.ai/integrations/tensorboard)

**Screenshots**
As shown in the screenshot, no metric / TensorBoard was logged.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - OS: Ubuntu 20.04.1
 - Browser: Chrome
 - Version:
   - wandb==0.10.15
   - tensorflow==2.3.0
   - tensorboard==2.4.1
   
**Additional context**
I haven't tested with logging into TensorBoard using `tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1)`.
