[Feature] Ability to retrieve content of non-media columns in a table without downloading entire artifact and associated media

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
We use tables to log validation results when a training run is finished. A row in this table will typically include the path to the input image, a score, and a W&B Image object. 

To access any data in this table at a later stage through, for example through `my_table.get_column['path']`, the entire artifact gets downloaded, including W&B image objects.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Ability to do `get_column` on a non-media column and retrieve its content without having to download the entire artifact. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A workaround is to download the table json and load it, but this defeats the purpose of having tables in the first place.
