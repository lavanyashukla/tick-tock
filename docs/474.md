TITLE:
Add GPU power to system metrics

LABEL:
enhancement

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Power draw in Watts is accessible through nvidia-smi and nvml and it is a better measure of GPU utilization. IE, power draw is be low when GPU is bottlenecked by memory bandwidth or network but other utilization measures are high

GPU Power state could also be useful to make sure GPU is not being throttled
