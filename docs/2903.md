[Q] Update Run config to correct name changes

Hey all,

WandB is one of my favorite tools to support my research. It helps a lot to structure your experiments.
But today I encountered a situation, which I could not solve. 

Following situation:
By solving a typo in a parameter name, I have runs with a parameter _label-a_ and runs with a parameter _label-b_. To solve this inconstancy, I want to add the parameter _label-b_ with the value of parameter  _label-a_ to my older runs. This would allow easier filters. 

The basic idea is very simple:

```
import wandb
api = wandb.Api()
runs = api.runs("entity/project_name", {"tags": "relevant"})

for run in runs:
    if "_label-b_" not in run.config.keys():
        run.config["_label-b_"] = run.config["_label-a_"]
```

But this way, the values aren't synced with the cloud. I already tried "run.update" with the same outcome. And I couldn't find anything in the documentation regarding this topic.

Is there a way to update the run-config after the run is finished, or is it a bad idea?

Best regards
Leon
