TITLE:
Better error message for an "inappropriate name"

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Right now I get this:

```
Let's setup this directory for W&B!
? Which team should we use?  wandb
? Which project should we use?  Create New
Enter a name for your new project: test
Error: test has been deemed inappropriate
```

I think it should say 

"Error: test is not an allowed name"
