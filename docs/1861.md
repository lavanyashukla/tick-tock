**Describe the bug**
[apologies for a clumsy title of this issue]
When running sweeps I create a new scatter plot, a "Distortion vs Rate" plot in an image compression setting (top left on the screenshots below).
(side note: the "Plot running maximum y values" works really well to draw a pareto frontier in such multi-objective optimization settings üôè )

Then I would like to investigate my logs, this is where the problem occurs.

A) When I select points on the "Loss v. created" plot (this one gets created automatically when a new sweep is started) the corresponding runs on the custom scatterplot are not highlighted.

B) When I select points on the custom scatterplot the corresponding runs on the bottom plot are not highlighted.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a sweep.
2. Create a custom scatterplot.
3. Highlight a range of runs.

**Expected behavior**
I would expect the corresponding runs in all figures to always be highlighted.

**Screenshots**
Included above.
