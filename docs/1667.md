**Describe the bug**
In this sweep: https://wandb.ai/kaiwenw/CartPole-v0/sweeps/1wkxr4hg?workspace=user-kaiwenw
I'm trying to filter by `w_net_config...explicitly_normalize_to_one` to be false or true. 
But the UI only shows "null" and when I type false or true, it does not apply the filter.


However, if you look at individual runs, the params are clearly false or true.
