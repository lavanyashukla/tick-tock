TITLE:
CLI `login` command incorrectly triggers interactive prompt

LABEL:

### Description

From a fresh install, attempting to log in via the command line using `wandb login <valid API key>` should succeed without requiring interactive input. Instead, it prompts for an API key interactively (see below).

The cause can be traced back to the addition of `public_api = PublicApi()` on line 210 of wandb/cli.py. To my understanding, this causes the `__init__()` method of the `PublicApi` class (which triggers the interactive prompt if API key is unknown) to be called prior to the execution of _any_ WandB CLI command. This behavior is undesirable, particularly because it renders `wandb login <key>` useless except when a user is already logged in.

### What I Did

```
$ wandb login <my-api-key-here>
wandb: (1) Create a W&B account
wandb: (2) Use an existing W&B account
wandb: (3) Don't visualize my results
wandb: Enter your choice:
```

For now, working around this by downgrading to version 0.9.2.
