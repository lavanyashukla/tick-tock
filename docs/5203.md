[CLI]: W&B process does not finish in VScode notebooks on a server

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
When I run wandb on VSCode on an ubuntu server through notebooks, I can never run a second instance by calling wandb.init() again. The last run never finishes to process and I have to restart the whole notebook. Re-importing the library does not help.

Importantly, it does say that "Successfully finished last run (ID:vdr8a51x). Initializing new run". All the data in each run is also logged. The only problem is re-initializing new runs. This is consistent on two separate servers I am working on.
