TITLE:
I'm trying to execute my code via SSH using 2 GPUs but I get this error

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I'm executing the training of YOLOv7 using Multi-GPU DistributedDataParallel Mode (https://docs.ultralytics.com/tutorials/multi-gpu-training/).

The error is: 
**FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'runs/train/exp52/weights'**

Using only one GPU everything is ok.

Why?
