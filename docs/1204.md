Logging metrics at different rates drops metrics / has inconsistent results.

### Description

As far as I can tell it is not possible to log metrics at different rates. My use case is as follows (but I'm sure you can contrive of a simpler use case):

- Generate metrics at every epoch
- At every  `% K` epochs request an async calculation of a time consuming metric (eg: Frechet Inception Distance such as here: https://github.com/jramapuram/async_fid) 
- The async callback pushes metrics after current epoch has passed but the data is never pushed.

```bash
test-0[Epoch 41][1600 samples][4.59 sec]:  Loss: 63.7088 -ELBO: 63.7088 NLL: 67.5594 KLD: -3.8506

```

Is there a workaround to this?
