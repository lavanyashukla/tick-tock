### Description

On Google Cloud, gs:// buckets are not recognised by `wandb.init(..., dir="gs://etc/etc")`

Reading and writing to buckets requires doing something like this: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/googlecloudstorageclient/read-write-to-cloud-storage#writing_to_cloud_storage

Or using tf.gfile

Since TPUs can **only** read and write checkpoints to `gs` this prevents us from using wanb whenever we want to use TPU hardware.
