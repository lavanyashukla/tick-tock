[App]: Can't log table - won't show up in Run Tables

STATE:

### Current Behavior

I am trying to log a dataset from a Jupyter notebook as a Table. When I run the code it creates a Table in my Workspace but says "No rows to display" instead of showing the data I tried to log. However, I can tell that the data is passed to WandB because if I navigate to Files/media/table and download the `.json` file located there I can see the data I am trying to pass in the `.json` file. To make sure it wasn't my code causing issues I tried running this sample notebook https://colab.research.google.com/github/wandb/examples/blob/master/colabs/tables/W%26B_Tables_Quickstart.ipynb and still was not able to see the table populated for the runs I did.

### Expected Behavior

I am expecting to see the Iris dataset from the example notebook linked above populated into the Table created by running this code.

### Steps To Reproduce

1. Run the notebook linked in Current Behavior
2. Check if the table is created as expected in the WandB web application

### Environment

OS: Windows 10

Browsers: Google Chrome

Version: 0.13.10


### Additional Context

I am using Weights and Biases through Run.AI so perhaps something about this setup is causing this issue. Normal Keras training logging is working as expected. So far it's only the Tables that I have seen not work.
