TITLE:
[Q] 2 questions regarding wandb tables

BODY:
Hi, I was logging a table to wandb and had a couple of questions:
1. I select rows = ["a","b","c"] when initializing wandb.Table, but on the client the columns are still labelled as 1,2, etc. Is there a way to actually change these labels? I did not see any examples of this in the docs, so I assume this is not yet possible?

2. Is there a way to export the table from the client? Like to .csv or .png?

Thanks a lot!
