TITLE:
Saving code from the whole directory instead of just main training file

BODY:
**Problem or Use Case**
Most of the times my machine learning code is modular, containing many different files in different folders.
As such, automatically storing only main training file is not really useful for me - maybe it would be better if wandb could store more files depending on which ones user will specify?

**Suggested Solution**
Allow user to specify the directory, which would be searched recursively for all python files. Wandb should store all those files and allow for their exploration in client.
