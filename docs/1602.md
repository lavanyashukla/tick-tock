Discrepancy between scatter plot and custom plot

**Describe the bug**
There seems to be a discrepancy between scatter plots generated using "Scatter plot" and those generated using "Custom chart".
The scatter chart looks accurate but the scatter plot seems to have a much larger number of runs.

**To Reproduce**
This seems to happen with any set of runs that I launch. Please let me know if you have trouble reproducing on your end and I can create a small program to share with you that will hopefully allow you to reproduce.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open the webpage for a sweep
2. Click the '+' on a panel and add a Scatter chart. Choose a hyperparameter and plot it against some metric like error or reward.
3. Click the '+' on a panel and add a Custom chart. Create an equivalent custom chart using the scatter plot option plotting the same metrics.

**Expected behavior**
I expect the two charts to essentially show the same thing.
