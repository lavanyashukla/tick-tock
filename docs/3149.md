[App] Bug: Undefined behaviour for line plot in the table view

**Describe the bug**
I'm making a line plot in the table view to show the validation loss across multiple runs. However, I'm experiencing an unexpected behavior that I can't interpret, and I believe it's a bug.

A few things seem broken:
1. The legend. How is the number 4 selected? The legend is created based on "class_weight & valid_split" (see screenshot below). I tried different ways, and showing valid_split=4 seems random. The runs with valid_split are neither the longest (i.e., most training steps) nor have the highest performance.
2. The groups are unintuitive. How are the runs grouped? I wanted to plot all 10 runs (i.e., a group with the key "class_weight & valid_split" unique for all runs). Given the legend is broken, I don't understand the meaning for each plot.


**Screenshots**
Here are the settings in the plots:
