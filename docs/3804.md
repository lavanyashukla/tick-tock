TITLE:
[Feature]: Mass delete runs

LABEL:

### Description

It is very common while debugging code to perform many runs, which may be a few seconds long, but which ultimately fail due to code bugs.

### Suggested Solution

There are two options for 'getting rid' of these erroneous runs.

One, we can disable WANDB with environment option. This is horrible because it messes up the workflow significantly and adds a very annoying switching cost while developing with wandb.

Two, we can delete runs posthoc in the user interface. For example, I can sort by ascending order of "runtime" and delete 20 runs at a time. The problem is, this is really inefficient. Please allow us to blanket delete runs that meet a certain criteria instead of 20 at a time. E.g. we should be able to delete all 10,000 runs with <20 runtime with one click.
