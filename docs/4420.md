TITLE:
[CLI]: `wandb sync` doesn't update summaries

### Describe the bug

When W&B crashes during a run and the dashboard stops populating with the run history, I use `wandb sync <path>` after the run finishes to upload the missing histories. This works, however, the summaries of the run are stuck on the last value that W&B received when the run was still online. This is annoying as I use the summaries (as exported to CSV) to plot the final accuracies of my runs.
