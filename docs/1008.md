wandb, version 0.8.34
Python 3.7.4
Linux


### Description

Using `wandb` with PyCharm in the interactive terminal. It seems that `wandb` is detecting the interactive terminal as a `jupyter` environment. PyCharm uses the pydev console, which is kinda like Jupyter, but not 100% compatible.

Happened upon upgrade from `0.8.33` -> `0.8.34`.
