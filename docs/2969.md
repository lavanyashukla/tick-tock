TITLE:
[Feature] Add the option to save continuously the weights of your model online in the Keras Callback

LABEL:

BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I was frustrated when I discovered that the Keras Callback actually only saved the model weights online once [here](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/v0.12.7/wandb/integration/keras/keras.py#L373), and then only saved to a local file [in this function](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/v0.12.7/wandb/integration/keras/keras.py#L901L920).

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I would like to have the possibility to save the model online, i.e. `wandb.save(self.filepath)`, at the end of every epoch.
This could be activated by a flag, but I think it should be the default.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I could definitely have my own callback but it defeats a bit the purpose of this callback imho.
For example:

```python
class MyWandbCallback(WandbCallback):
    def _save_model(self, epoch):
        super()._save_model(epoch)
        wandb.save(self.filepath)
```
