### Description

The documentation describes the `root` argument of `wandb.restore()` as

> string specifying the directory in which to store the local copy of the file. This defaults to the current working directory, or the `wandb.run.dir` if wandb.init was called earlier (default: ".")

However the `root` argument has no affect if there was no previous `wandb.init` call:

### Test Code

```python
import wandb, os

f = wandb.restore('config.yaml', root='/tmp/foo', run_path="borisd13/colorizer/runs/dckzfkk5", replace=True) 
expected = os.path.join('/tmp/foo', 'config.yaml')               
actual = f.name               
print(f"actual='{actual}', expected='{expected}'")
```
prints
```
actual='./config.yaml', expected='/tmp/foo/config.yaml'
```
It works as expected with an additional `wandb.init()` call.
