Missing GPU metrics after moving to another server

BODY:
Hi, we have recently moved our entire filesystem to a new provider. When we try to log our experiments with wandb, everything gets displayed correctly except for the GPU stats. Only the GPU power usage gets displayed but the rest is empty. Our GPUs have changed from Nvidia V100s to Nvidia T4s. We use wandb 0.10.7, python 3.6.9. Could you give advice on how to make this feature work? We tried reinstalling wandb, but had no success.
