TITLE:
[CLI]: Cannot resume run if I specify the name

### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->

<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
model_checkpoint_exists = True

wandb.init(
    project="project-name",
    resume=model_checkpoint_exists,
    name="groovy-grape-192",
)
```

When I stop experiments, then start them again using the snippet above, the web UI shows two different runs with the same name.
I want to resume the previous run (`resume=True`), but it creates a new run with the same name. If I don't specify the name, I can resume a run.

I would like to resume runs, with a custom name.
