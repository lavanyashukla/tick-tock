### Description

On the web UI, when visualizing all the runs under a project there's a column called Created, which says when the run was made. It shows the relative time from the present (ie `7h ago` or `1d ago`), and if you hover the mouse on top of the label, it shows the exact time (ie `2020-06-05 20:31`).

Personally, I often find myself searching for the experiment I run yesterday after lunch at 13:30, or the one I ran today at 9:00. It would be nice to have the ability to toggle the default format to the exact time, as I usually end up doing more mental math than needed to visually search for the experiment I'm looking for.

By the way, I love the product! Thanks for the great work.
