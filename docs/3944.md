TITLE:
`wandb.apis.public.Run.upload_file` overwrites the file if already exists in `wandb` remote

LABEL:
c:api

STATE:
open

BODY:
So the default behavior of https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/public-api/run#upload_file is to upload the file without taking into consideration whether that file was already there or not, so it's not actually checking whether the file exists in the `wandb` remote or not, it's just uploading it.

Shouldn't this be handled through a parameter `replace: bool = False` just like for https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/public-api/file#download?

I've been playing around with these functions these days and I've filled one PR for each function:
* https://github.com/wandb/client/pull/3929
* https://github.com/wandb/client/pull/3924

But is this something we should consider? Or the default behavior is supposed to work like this?

Thanks! ðŸ¤—
