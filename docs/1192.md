TITLE:
Create wandb run with run name that was previously deleted

LABEL:
feature_request,c:rewind

STATE:
open

BODY:
`wandb --version && python --version && uname`

* Weights and Biases version: version  0.8.31 (I also had same issue on 0.9.4)
* Python version: 3.7.3
* Operating System: Linux

### Description
I deleted one run in wandb web interface. 
Then I tried to create new run with the same name as deleted run, but I got error (see below).
I often find useful to experiment with wandb logging before using it in training. Because wandb doesn't allow overwriting data, I have to create new run every time for small test or wait until run overwrite all previous data. I think it would be more convenient for development to allow delete run (to clean run data) and then create new run with the same name.

### What I Did
here is traceback
