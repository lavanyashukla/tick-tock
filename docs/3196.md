TITLE:
[Feature Request] An option similar to VIEWS in SQL 

LABEL:

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The main page of a project always loads all the runs in the project, which takes a long time. If I choose certain filters, it takes a long time for me to switch them when I am working on multiple projects.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The ability to create and store views of a table, and retrieve them in a click. This is similar to a VIEW in SQL which are stored set of filters.

In my case, if I could create separate views based on TAGS and other parameters, it would be quicker to load (and update) the UI.

I'm not completely sure if something like this exists already. If not, kindly consider this.
