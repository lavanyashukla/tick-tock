TITLE:
wandb.init(reinit=True) doesn't work in Windows

LABEL:
stale

STATE:
closed

BODY:
The command crashes with the following error:

```bash
OSError: [WinError 6] The handle is invalid
```

Currently the only work around is to not use reinit and instead call your training script in it's own sub process:

```python
import os
for i in range(10):
    os.system("python train.py args")
```

The underlying cause is the way Windows handles file descriptors and inheritance.  We're currently working on a major refactor that will change the ways in which file descriptors are used.  If you're hitting this issue, please follow this thread and we'll update everyone once this is fixed.
