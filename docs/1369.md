TITLE:
[Feature request] filtering runs by summary metrics

LABEL:
feature_request

STATE:
closed

BODY:
It would be great to extend the filtering in the run table\dashboard and allow summary metrics to be keys in filters.

Use-case: 
I'm running a sweep, and want to take a closer look at the runs that perform better than a certain loss threshold.  I don't see any easy way to filter those runs only right now. (If such a way exists, my apologies, please, point it out to me!).
