[Feature]: Directly state that wandb sync --clean only removes synced runs

### Description

When running `wandb sync --include-globs offline-run-*`, `wandb` ask me to confirm that I want to remove `n` runs.
Though it is stated in the command's documentation, I propose to rewrite the messages to state directly that the command will only remove synced runs.

### Suggested Solution

A quick solution would be changing the line

`Are you sure you want to remove 1234 runs? [y/N]:`

to

`Are you sure you want to remove 1234 **synced** runs? [y/N]:`

This makes it clear that only synced runs are deleted, and gives me ease of mind.

### Alternatives

The alternative would be to leave as is, which works fine; the refined confirmation prompt would prevent possible irritations.
