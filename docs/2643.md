TITLE:
Null metrics in sweep table results, but not in charts[App]

STATE:

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
In my sweeps, most of the metrics in the sweep table are shown as '-' but the metric data in the charts is complete and correct.

**Expected behavior**
Barring an error, I expect the sweeps table to show the metrics for easy comparison

**Screenshots**
Some runs in the sweep tables are missing data:

Charts still contain all the data. Please note all runs ran the full # of epochs, but they are using differing degrees of batch_accumulation which is why they completed a different number of steps.
