[Q] How to start a new sweep of grid search without repeating prior runs

BODY:
Hi everyone. When a sweep of grid search finishes, I often want to start a new grid search that might have some overlaps with the previous one. For example, the previous sweep might configure the parameter a in {0.01, 0.001} and b in {0.01, 0.001}, and next I want a new sweep with a in {0.1, 0.01} and b in {0.1, 0.01}. But by selecting prior runs and starting a new sweep, the "--a=0.01 --b=0.01" would be rerun. Is there a way to prevent this?
