TITLE:
[CLI] wandb.restore() does not work for sweep runs v0.11.2 

LABEL:

**Description**
It is not possible to restore a model (or any other file) using version 0.11.2 when considered "runs" executed in a Sweep: 

wandb.restore('file', run_path="user/project/hash")

This only works if run_path is related to a "run" that was executed without a Sweep.

I had tested the same procedure with version 0.10.17 and it worked. Apparently, it is problem in version 0.11.2.
