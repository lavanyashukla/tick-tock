BODY:
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I want to programatically resume a sweep (eg. after it's finished, some runs fail, I want to delete the runs via the api and then resume the run). Also I want to know the current run state via the API.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Give access to sweep status and controls via API.
