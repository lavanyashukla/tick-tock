TITLE:
[App]: Filter option "NOT IN" doesn't work correctly

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

Within a particular group, selecting the filter option "NOT IN" with a set of options doesn't show any run. But using each of the options individually with "is not" works.

### Expected Behavior

The runs shown for  "NOT IN a,b,c" should be same as "is not a"+"is not b"+"is not c"
