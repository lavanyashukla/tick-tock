fastai2 integration

**Describe the bug**
The integration with fastai was moved to fastai with fastai2. Nevertheless, I'd aprecciate if you could have a look at the implementation, because currently it's broken. You introduce a breaking change in your API by increasing the step counter with every log call (now one needs to explicitly turn `commit=False` off, in order to have the original behaviour). I tried to fix this over in fastai with the following PR: https://github.com/fastai/fastai/pull/3067

Yet, something is still off and I'd appreciate your help in debugging/fixing.

I train my model for 5 epochs, and this is the accuracy plot in wandb:

And this is the fastai training output:
```
epoch     train_loss  valid_loss  accuracy  b_score  ece       nll       err  time    
0         7.291822    6.423790    0.891155  0.022018     0.056384  6.423790  0.122854           05:19

4         5.873019    5.817275    0.922017  0.015450     0.049534  5.817275  0.111537           05:17      
```
The wandb plot in numbers:
```
epoch 
0     0.8912
1     0.9066
2     0.8771
3     0.9091
4     0.01545
```

So something is broken in the last epoch. 
`wandb, version 0.10.11`

```
python3 -c "import fastai; import torch; import fastcore; print(torch.__version__, fastai.__version__, fastcore.__version__)"
1.7.0+cu110 2.1.8 1.3.9
```
