[Q] Visualize new changes in the logged metrics after resuming a run

Hi,
I use pytorch and I'm currently trying to add the possibility to resume a finished simulation; the code seem to work fine [load and save a model](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html).
Since I also use wandb I'd like to retrieve also all the logs started on the  first half of the simulation.
Following one of the possibilities suggested [here](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/resuming) I modified the initialization as follows:

```
if (StartMode=='BEGIN'):
    StartEpoch = 0
    StartIterationCounter=0
    ProjId = wandb.util.generate_id()
elif(StartMode=='RECAP'):
    #here we retrieve the model and state of the old checkpoint; first initialize the model and optimizer, then load the dictionary locally.
    checkpoint = torch.load(FolderPath +'/model.pt') #load the model (substitute with the right pathas argument)
    NetInstance.model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
    NetInstance.optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict'])
    ProjId = checkpoint['proj_id']
    StartEpoch = checkpoint['epoch']
    StartIterationCounter = checkpoint['step']   
    n_epochs = n_epochs + StartEpoch
    #we have also to recall the old variables:
        #- we load them in different container; in this way to fill the new files' variable we can directly charge the old ones and the new one
    NetInstance.RecallOldVariables()

run = wandb.init(project= ProjName,
           group =  GroupName,#with the group parameter you can organize runs divide them into groups
           notes="some comments",
           entity= "user_name"
           name = RunName,
           id = ProjId, #you can use id to resume the corresponding run; to do so you need also to express the resume argument properly
           resume="allow"
           #,reinit=True #If you're trying to start multiple runs from one script, add two things to your code: (1) run = wandb.init(reinit=True): Use this setting to allow reinitializing runs
           )

NetInstance.CustomizedX_Axis() #set the customized x-axis in a automatic way for all the exported charts

wandb.config = {
  "Algorithm": Dynamic,
  "Imbalance_ratio":UnbalanceFactor,
  "learning_rate": learning_rate,
  "epochs": n_epochs,
  "batch_size": batch_size,
  "Number_of_channel_grous_(group_norm)": group_factor,
  "Percentage_of_Elements_Dropped_out" : dropout_p,
  "Imbalance_ratio":UnbalanceFactor,
  "architecture": args.Architecture,
  "Dataset":args.Dataset
}
```
where `StartMode` is the flag that establish if we are starting a run from 0 or resuming an old one; in the first case we create a new unique id with `wandb.util.generate_id()`, while in the second case we use the one saved from the first half of the run.
`NetInstance` is just the instance of a class from where my model is defined.
Proceding in this way I can resume the previous run and update for example the file uploaded on wandb.

On the other hand also if in the new simulation (resuming the old one, i.e. with `StartMode=='RECAP'`) I try to add new values to the former logged metrics using `wandb.log('old metrics': new values)` they don't appear on the dashboard's chart.
What am I missing?

[EDIT]
Form this [link](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/resuming) I think that wandb.restore is the step that misses in my code:
> This will allow you to log new historical values for your metrics to a run starting from where you left off 

But when I click on the [link](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/save-restore#examples-of-wandb.restore) to get more info, the page only explain how to restore file, it doesn't say anything about the metrics
