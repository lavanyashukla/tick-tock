[CLI] Rate limiting on HP Sweep

**Description**
Running hyperparameter sweep  with ~7 agents across ~5 machines (I am simply executing the same function `python my_sweep.py` each time to start up a new agent - is this the correct way to do this?). Using the wandb Pytorch lightning callback, I am logging ~100 scalars (no images, audio, etc) every 2-10 seconds for each machine run (could be ~3 runs on a given machine).

Most of my machines print: `wandb: Network error (HTTPError), entering retry loop.` every time I run my validation step (every 15 epochs), which is where most of my logging is happening.

I also often get:
```
429 response executing GraphQL.
{"error":"rate limit exceeded"}

Retry attempt failed:
Traceback (most recent call last):

```

When I attempt to view my runs on W&B's UI, I often get a blank screen with 'rate limit exceeded' in the middle of the page:

 and I often to refresh it many times to get it to display things. 

Also, when working with data on the UI, it often cuts out and displays this error message

Some of these problems seem to go away when I reduce the number of agents to 1 or 2, but seem to stile present at 3.

Is this expected behavior? I thought I was able to run ~20 agents simultaneously, especially if I am not logging anything big like images. Or maybe I am not invoking agents correctly?
