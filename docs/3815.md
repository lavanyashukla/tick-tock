TITLE:
[Feature]: Showing first x runs & Pagination

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
### Description

* When one exports as an image a panel containing several runs, the mention _`Showing first x runs`_ remains on the final image (see figure below), which harms for example the visual rendering of the figures of scientific articles.

* The pagination disappears when one hides all the runs. This is only the case if there are runs in progress (see the first two figures below). When there is no run in progress everything works normally even if all runs are hidden (see the last figure below).
