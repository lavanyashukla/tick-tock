TITLE:
Tensorboard: PyTorch writer.add_scalars() does not work as intented.

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I tried the code as follows:
```python
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
import wandb
wandb.tensorboard.patch(tensorboardX=False, pytorch=True)
wandb.init()
writer = SummaryWriter()
scalars = {
    'scalar_1': 1.0,
    'scalar_2': 2.0,
    'scalar_3': 3.0
}
writer.add_scalars('test', scalars, global_step=1)
writer.close()
wandb.finish()
```

My observations:
1. There is a warning that I face with my implementation which is as follows:
```
wandb: WARNING When using several event log directories, please call wandb.tensorboard.patch(root_logdir="...") before wandb.init
```
I have tried figuring out the `root_dir` parameter, due to the unavailability of a docstring or documentation, I was not able to remove the warning.
2. If we ignore the warning the tensorboard integration in wandb does not really work like the one in colab.
|The file structure of the event files that are logged by the `SummaryWriter` are|But in the wandb folder the event files are not structured the same way|

Here we do not see the folders namely `test_scalar_1`, `test_scalar_2`, `test_scalar_3`.

This leads us to the bug in the tensorboard integration

Here we do not notice the anything in the `runs` section of `wandb tensorboard`.

I am suspecting a probable issue with https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/30f77c8a320fe42a519f76eb012e61101afad9ba/wandb/integration/tensorboard/monkeypatch.py#L90
