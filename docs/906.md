### Description

I work with `slurm` that will recieve my training task and execute it. But, since my collegues are using the slurm at the same time, each person will have a maximal submits. This means, some tasks are submitted, but go into waiting list, until resources are released.

I am using the config-default.yaml to register all my hyperparams, but once the task goes to waiting list, if I overwrite the .yaml file as the same time, then when the task is finally executed, the yaml loaded will be the latest version of that file. I know this is not a bug inside wandb, but is that possible, that your team can find a solution for this?
