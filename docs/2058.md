Client hanging + Leaked Semaphores

Hi, 

My agent hangs sometimes and when I kill it, throws a warning about leaked semaphore objects.

Here is the warning:
```
 There appear to be 6 leaked semaphore objects to clean up at shutdown
  warnings.warn('resource_tracker: There appear to be %d '

```
When it runs, sometimes (sometimes other than when it hangs) produces the following warning:
```
wandb: WARNING Config item 'combine_loss' was locked by 'sweep' (ignored update).
wandb: WARNING Config item 'combine_embeddings' was locked by 'sweep' (ignored update).
```

This warning is referenced in https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/9589. It seems to be a Python 3.8 thing. Will try with Python 3.7. 

My workflow is rather straightforward
-- Creating a yaml file
-- Creating wandb.init(config = {config1: ..., config2: ...)
-- wandb sweep sweep.yaml
And running the agent.

I am using Pytorch Lightning (1.2); when I run my train.py file standalone, it runs fine. Some of the sweep runs run fine too, but at times, the program hangs and when I kill it manually, it kills fine but leaves me a warning that 6 semaphores are still locked when the program was killed.

At one point, I ran into a CUDA out of memory error, which I think is somehow linked to the zombie files that were still locked (could have been locked on my GPU).

I didnâ€™t face these issues before using wandb, and so think this locks not being released has something to do with it.


I referred to part of this issue (just the warnings in a comment under #1698) but want to make this a standalone issue to couple it with the agent hanging.
