TITLE:
[Q] Why doesn't `wandb sync --include-offline` upload any metrics?

BODY:
I am running wandb in offline mode on SLURM; the runs have completed, when I try to sync, only the sweeps ids are synced, but neither the runs nor the metrics show up. The reporting works fine in online mode.

I am syncing the runs with `wandb sync` (also tried `wandb sync --include-offline`). But, no metrics are uploaded, I don't even know where are they stored on disk so that I could parse them manually. 

The following error occurs when trying to sync a specific run

```
Syncing: https://wandb.ai/ndrwnaguib/ai4l/runs/fqtlxdz1 ...Exception in thread Thread-1:
Traceback (most recent call last):

```

Any thoughts what could have gone wrong? Thanks.
