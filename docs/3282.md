TITLE:
[feature request] Function to trigger a sync manually without calling wandb.finish (also possibly a way to perform a sync synchronously / wait for completion of sync)

### Describe the bug

I'm doing a single `wandb.log({...}, step=iteration)` call. It's now 2000 iterations, the run is displayed at wandb.ai, but has no logged data.

How to force commits / syncs to happen regularly? I want to use wandb to get a sense that learning is happening, not to wait until the end of the run to see the stats.
