TITLE:
[CLI] RuntimeError: OrderedDict mutated during iteration

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I am getting a `RuntimeError: OrderedDict mutated during iteration` error whenever I try to do _any forward_ calls with a model that I have previously called `wandb.watch` on. **This does not happen when I do not call `wandb.watch` on the model**. I have manually tested all wandb versions from `0.10.27` and upwards and can confirm that this error only starts to appear in `0.10.30` and is not fixed in `0.10.31`.

In this specific traceback I am also using PytorchLightning, however I was getting the same error in an other project without Lightning. I have been forced to downgrade `wandb` to `0.10.29` due to this.

Traceback:
```sh
