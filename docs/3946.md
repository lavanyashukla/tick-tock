[Q] C:\Users\MyName\anaconda3\envs\ML\python.exe: can't find '__main__' module in '' when running wandb agent on terminal

Hi, I started a hyperparam sweep on a notebook to get a feel for how it works but I had to pause it. I would like to continue running this run through my terminal by running the command given in the info tab of my sweep. But every time I try to run this command, I see that I get the correct sweep configuration that comes through but then when it tries to run I get the following 
error C:\Users\MyName\anaconda3\envs\ML\python.exe: can't find '__main__' module in '' which cancels the run. 

I'm not adamant about running it through the command line but I can't find in the documentation how to continue a hyperparameter sweep run through jupyter. 
Andy help is appreciated.

Thanks.
