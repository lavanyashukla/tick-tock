TITLE:
[Q] Accessing 2D projections in a custom chart

LABEL:

Hi,

I am attempting to create a customised embedding visualisation panel, and would like to see if there are ways to expand upon the built-in 2D Projection plot provided in wandb.

Is it possible for a custom chart to access the row["projection.x"] and row["projection.y"] attributes that are created when converting a Table into a 2D projection?

Alternatively, is it possible to customise further the 2D Projection itself? For example, enabling logical expressions in the marker definition to use a certain marker shape according to the label, instead of having all markers being the same.

Thanks.
