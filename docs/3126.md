Hello,

I used this code to create a confusion matrix:
```

# confusion matrix
        wandb.log({"confusion-matrix-test": wandb.plot.confusion_matrix(
            probs=None,
            y_true=all_gt, preds=all_pre,
            class_names=classes_names)})
```

However, Wanda's website only shows a table instead of the confusion matrix. This is a screenshot from the issue:
