[CLI] The live log graph is not shown when running jupyter notebook in vscode

**Description**
Thank you for the amazing software, I have been enjoying using wandb.

I want to show the logged graph locally in my jupyter notebook (.ipynb), so I follow this [example](https://docs.wandb.ai/integrations/jupyter). However, it would not show the plot but this instead.

**Wandb features**
I follow the code exactly from this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XarrwLYCGmMUGBSe7eymzofIfSwytuKC?usp=sharing#scrollTo=SCfw64uGfUPs)

**How to reproduce**
1. Run this [jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XarrwLYCGmMUGBSe7eymzofIfSwytuKC?usp=sharing#scrollTo=SCfw64uGfUPs)  in vscode

**Environment**
- OS: Ubuntu 18.04
- Environment: vscode
- Python Version: 3.8.8

PS. I am not sure if it's wandb issue or vscode issue
