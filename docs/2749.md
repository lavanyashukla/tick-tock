**Description**

I'm working on encoder-decoder like architecture, with multi-models (i.e., e_1, d_1, e_2, d_2, and e_3, d_3). At the moment, I'm only interested in the gradients flow of the e_3 and d_3, so that I call the wandb.watch() with the following command:
```python
        self.wandb.watch(models=[self.model.module.encoder_3, self.model.module.decoder_3],
                         log='gradients',
                         log_freq=100, log_graph=False)
```
before the training start.

However, I cannot find the "gradients" section in the board.

In addition, wandb version that I used is the latest one at the moment, wandb-0.12.4. 
Is there any thing I did wrong? 
I appreciate all the help !!!
