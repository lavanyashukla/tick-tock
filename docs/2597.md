rate limit exceeded

BODY:
I have many experiments in parallel and I am using wandb to track experiments, but suddenly on wandb all processes crashed but experiments on my server are still in progress. What should I do to get the control again without interrupting my processes?
from wandb log file
"rate limit exceeded, retrying in 2.040469904300563 seconds), retrying request "
