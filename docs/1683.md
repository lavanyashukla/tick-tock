TITLE:
Not logging the None values in the wandb

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
`None` values in 
```python 
wandb.config
``` 
are not showing in the comparison table.

To reproduce, simply set any parameter (i.e. max_iter) 
```python
wandb.config.max_iter = None
``` 
and try to find the column max_iter in the comparison table at:

`wandb.ai/username/projectname/table?workspace=user-username`,

where *username* is the login name and *projectname* is the name of the project that you're currently in.

I would expect the `None` values still to get logged, i.e. to know the expected behavior of the estimator in *sklearn* as some of the parameters during training are `None`.
