TITLE:
[CLI] W&B Network Usage Bug -- 1.6TB of egress charges of GCP train 4 YOLOv5n models

LABEL:
cli

STATE:
closed

BODY:
First raised with @AyushExel in https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/5071 a month ago, but no progress in the intervening time period so raising this issue directly here.

I trained 4 (very small) models, only 4MB each, over 3 days on a GCP instance, and saw enormous network egress costs related to 1,600 GB of data sent from the instance. I'm assuming **all of this is W&B traffic**, as there were no other processes running on the instance. The egress to W&B steadily rose over the training time and by the end of the training was steadily increasing around 8 MB/s, nonstop 24/7, dropping back to zero after training completion.

Yesterday October 5th GCP charged us $67 just for that day for this network traffic:

I've also been seeing steady errors on the console related to the W&B connection:

An example run from this project that caused the above problem is here. I can't imagine what would have caused these four runs to transmit 1,600 GB of data off the instance in just 3 days. Please send this to the team for review. Thank you.
