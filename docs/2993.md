Hi W&B Team,

Thanks for the awesome tool! Here's a feature request that would make our lives much easier.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
We are using W&B to track our datasets. From parent datasets, we often create derived datasets. A derived dataset will contain references to a subset of one or multiple parent dataset. As such, it is not possible to pass a single path to `add_reference` as files will not sit in a single cloud storage directory, but instead are scattered across the parent dataset directories.

The only solution we have found so far is to loop through all the files we need to reference, and pass one file at a time to `add_reference`. As you can imagine, this is very slow (typically ~10 references a second, which translates into hours for large datasets).

**Describe the solution you'd like**
The ability to pass a list of references to add to `add_reference`.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
N/A

**Additional context**
