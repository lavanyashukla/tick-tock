TITLE:
early stopping envelope seem to have no effect

### Description
We have configured wandb to perform early stoppin. However, even after 80 runs nothing was early-stopped.

### What I Did
Our config file `config.yml` contains the following lines:
```yaml
early_terminate:
  type: envelope
method: bayes
```
It seem to have no effect on runs. Is it supported? If yes, how can we check/ensure early-stopping works properly?

Thanks!
