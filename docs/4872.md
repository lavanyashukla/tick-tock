TITLE:
[Q] wandb stream ID error

LABEL:
c:service,c:console

STATE:
closed

BODY:
I tried running using wandb with optuna. Most of the times it works but some times the following error occurs and this code runs but the results are not sent to the wandb website (only the system information like CPU usage and so on gets sent)

```
Exception in thread SockSrvRdThr:...
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/threading.py", line 932, in _bootstrap_inner
    self.run()
  File "/home/connectome/dyhan316/.conda/envs/VAE_3DCNN_older_MONAI/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/sdk/service/server_sock.py", line 112, in run
    shandler(sreq)

    iface = self._mux.get_stream(stream_id).interface
  File "/home/connectome/dyhan316/.conda/envs/VAE_3DCNN_older_MONAI/lib/python3.8/site-packages/wandb/sdk/service/streams.py", line 206, in get_stream
    stream = self._streams[stream_id]
KeyError: 'zyeausrv'
```
given that this is  caused by `wandb` I was wondering if this was a wandb issue! 

(I tried as https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/3223#issuecomment-1032820724 says, by setting `os.environ["WANDB_START_METHOD"]="thread"` but the same problem occurred)
