### Current Behavior

So far I've been using the following code snippet to log in the GPU metric for my colab notebooks and it worked. But recently, wandb only logs CPU metrics and does not show GPU metric for the colab notebook on running the same code. Please respond,it's a bit urgent. Thanks!

`!pip install wandb`
`import wandb`
`wandb.init(project="")`
