TITLE:
[Q] How do I download a specific run from a project?

LABEL:

BODY:
I am looking at the [Export API](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/public-api-guide) and I tried the following:
```
import wandb
api = wandb.Api()
run = api.run("<entity>/<project>/<run_id>")
```
But I run into `ValueError: Could not find project <project>/<run_id>` error. This error does not appear when I do not provide the run_id, but instead loop over all the runs in the dataset.
