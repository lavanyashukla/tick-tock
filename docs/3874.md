TITLE:
[CLI]: log gradients broken for subclassed keras models

### Describe the bug

For tensorflow keras, the WandbCallback cannot log gradients for a subclassed model. This due to the following line: https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/integration/keras/keras.py#L513, which accesses `model.inputs` which is `None` in the case of a subclassed model. Instead, probably the easiest thing is to accept an extra argument that provides input dimensions. That way, the callback can make it's own new tf.keras.Input layer.
