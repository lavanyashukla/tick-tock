### Describe the bug

<!--- Description of the issue below  -->
The integration with `gradio` works fine when running a jupyter cell, but with the very same code ran as a python script, WandB is not picking up media (gradio media).
<!--- A minimal code snippet between the quotes below  -->
```python
import gradio as gr
import wandb

with gr.Blocks() as block:
    gr.Dropdown(["a", "b", "c"])

wandb.init()
block.launch(share=True)
block.integrate(wandb=wandb)
```

<!--- A full traceback of the exception in the quotes below -->
```shell
WandB run is correctly initiated. gradio local and public links as well.
```


### Additional Files

_No response_

### Environment

WandB version: 0.15.0

OS: MacOS  13.2.1

Python version:  3.9.16

Versions of relevant libraries:
gradio == 3.27.0


### Additional Context

I asked to the `gradio` community as well, but there is no solution from their part yet. Same issue with gradio's `interface`:
````
import gradio as gr
import wandb

def _hello(text):
    return text

wandb.init()

io = gr.Interface(
    fn=_hello, 
    inputs=gr.Dropdown(["a", "b", "c"]), 
    outputs=gr.Textbox()
)

io.launch(share=True)
io.integrate(wandb=wandb)
````
