TITLE:
[App]: Table view column add dialog box doesn't find metrics

LABEL:
app

STATE:
open

BODY:
### Current Behavior

When I search metrics (that are being logged) in the 'Manage Columns' dialog box in the web app Table view, metrics matching my search query briefly appear, but immediately disappear from the Hidden Columns and Visible Columns panels. This occurs regardless of whether I search with Fuzzy or Exact or RegExp, and regardless of whether I have visible runs or not. I have 1800 candidate columns (lots of configs and lots of metrics), maybe this has something to do with it. Used to work without any problem before.

### Expected Behavior

Metrics and configs matching the search term should appear in the search boxes.

### Steps To Reproduce

Go to Table view. Click 'Columns'. Enter search term.
