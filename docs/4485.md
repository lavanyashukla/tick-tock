### Description

Hi there! I have the following use case: for some groups, I'd like to visualize a scatter plot of their performance.  e.g. below (sorry for the poor quality).

In w&b right now, I can "group by", but when I go to scatter plot where it looks like this ungrouped,

It then looks like this when grouped.

Not sure if this is a bug or a feature. Please feel free to allocate accordingly!

Thank you for an amazing tool â€“ I'm a big fan and proponent.

### Suggested Solution

Grouping by should have the same functionality as elsewhere (e.g. in line plots): it should preserve the different runs across the axes and show all the points. Perhaps this could be done with line plots? I couldn't figure out how b/c line plots only take as the x axis things like step, where I want to do this over a hyperparameter in a sweep.
