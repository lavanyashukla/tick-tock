Wandb 0.9.x OSError: [Errno 95] Operation not supported

`wandb --version && python --version && uname`

* Weights and Biases version: 0.9.1, 0.9.2, 0.9.3, 0.9.4, 0.10.0rc1
* Wandb-ng version: 0.0.33, 0.0.36
* Python version: 3.6.9, 3.8.2, 3.8.3
* Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04)

### Description
When trying to run a script that is on a network mounted folder like a Windows share or also from a symbolic link all Wandb versions that are higher than `0.8.36` will throw the following error `OSError: [Errno 95] Operation not supported: 'runs/run-xxxxxxxx_xxxxxx-xxxxxxxx' -> 'latest.12473'` where `xxxxxxxx_xxxxxx-xxxxxxxx` is the date, time and run unique id (I think).

It seems like Wandb is trying to create the folder where it will store the information for the current/latest run but it fails, as I said it only happens on version higher than `0.8.36` so I guess something was changed on `_WandbInit._safe_symlink()` which is on the `wandb/sdk/wandb_init.py` file after that version and that broke wandb so it doesnt work correctly now on symbolic links.

### What I Did
I tried using multiple Python versions and multiple Operating Systems as I wasn't sure what was the problem or were it was coming from at first because previously wandb was working, I upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04 so that was the first thing I thought was causing the problem as many things can break after an upgrade, then tried different Python versions just in case it was something caused by a broken Python installation, then I started testing the different Wandb versions from the newest and going back one version at the time until I found one that worked.

Paste the command(s) you ran and the output.
If there was a crash, please include the traceback here.

This is the command I used to run my script, the script is not the problem and the python version on here shows Python 3.6 as that was the last version I tested.
