TITLE:
Cannot import wandb after importing attributedict 

LABEL:

STATE:

BODY:
**Describe the bug**

If one imports wandb *after* import attributedict there is an error. However, this doesn't happen always. I do not yet know why it doesn't happen when it doesn't, but below I give a Dockerfile that will reproduce the error


**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create a Dockerile
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip

RUN pip3 install attributedict==0.3.0
RUN pip3 install wandb==0.10.13

RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash feynman
USER feynman
WORKDIR /home/feynman

RUN echo "import wandb;print('imported wandb');import attributedict;print('imported attributedict')" > non-buggy.py
RUN echo "import attributedict;print('imported attributedict');import wandb;print('imported wandb')" > buggy.py
CMD /bin/bash
```
2. Build the dockerfile `docker build . -t wandb_bug`
3. Run a container `docker run -it wandb_bug`
4. In the container run `python3 non-buggy.py` to see that there is no bug if wandb is imported before attributedict
5. Now run `python3 buggy.py` to see the following bug
```feynman@e5fb9cee4fb0:~$ python buggy.py 
imported attributedict
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.9/pkgutil.py", line 416, in get_importer
    importer = sys.path_importer_cache[path_item]
KeyError: None

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

```

**Expected behavior**
Wandb import before or after attributedict import should give the same behavior and in particular should not give an error.


**Operating System**
 I have tried this on various flavors of Ubuntu and its always there. The Dockerfile captures all the state info in any case.

**Additional context**

There is one curious feature which I cannot give details for reproducing. If I mount my home directory onto the container and run the script from there then there is no error. I show this in the video. Obviously I cannot share contents of my home directory and therefore this is not reproducible but it is curious to see that while the bug is there on a fresh install, it is not there when the script is being launched from my home directory where presumably some wandb files already exist and are interacting with wandb when it initializes.
