[Q] How to sweep with multiple GPU

Hi,
I have 8 GPUs that are able to load wandb agent, how can I utilize them?
In https://wandb.ai/site/articles/multi-gpu-sweeps, I have learned command `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 wandb agent SWEEP_ID`
So can I use the following command to sweep 8 runs at the same time?
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 wandb agent SWEEP_ID`
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 wandb agent SWEEP_ID`
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 wandb agent SWEEP_ID`
...
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=7 wandb agent SWEEP_ID`
