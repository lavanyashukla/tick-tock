### Environment

OS: Linux (5.14.0-1038-oem)

### Additional Context

While [the tutorial](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/huggingface#turn-on-model-versioning) says that `WANDB_LOG_MODEL=true` will turn on model versioning, `WANDB_LOG_MODEL` does not appear to be a [documented environment variable](https://github.com/wandb/client/blob/master/wandb/env.py). It also doesn't seem to appear [anywhere in the code](https://github.com/wandb/client/search?q=WANDB_LOG_MODEL).

To me, this seems to be the reason why it's ignored - it was never programmed in the first place. Does that seem to be correct? (If not, where is the code that implements this? I may be doing something wrong on my end.)
