TITLE:
[App] Renaming projects only accepts lower-case names

LABEL:

STATE:
closed

BODY:
**Describe the bug**
When creating a project (either in Web App or through API) its name can be arbitrary, but when renaming a project, the web-app only accepts lower-case letters.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to 'Project Overview'
2. Click on '.... next to a Project' and click rename
3. The current project name is prefilled in the input-field, containing also uppercase letters 
4. As soon as you start editing the project name it is coerced into a lower-case string and does not accept any uppercase input

**Expected behavior**
Use same naming-validator for renaming of projects (incl. allowing uppercase) that is also used for creating projects.

**Operating System**
 - OS: Ubuntu 20 LTS
 - Browser: Chrome
 - Version: Current online version as of Oct 29, 2021
