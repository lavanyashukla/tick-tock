[Feature] Ability to re-size tables

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
In tables when the logged string is long, it takes up a lot of screen space. This makes it so that on smaller screens, it's difficult to see columns that proceed it.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'd be nice if we could re-size the columns, or shrink them so that strings span more than one line in order to fit all columns on the screen. 

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Maybe re-ordering columns so we can choose which ones we prefer to see first, but this is still a bit of an inconvenience. 

**Additional context**
See in this screenshot how the strings are so long I can't see my metrics (to the right)
