TITLE:
wandb.restore doesn't respect root argument

LABEL:
bug

STATE:
closed

BODY:
The `root` argument for `wandb.restore` is described as follows:
> The directory to download the file to.  Defaults to the current directory or the run directory if wandb.init was called.

However when `wandb.init` has been called, it *always* uses the run directory, so the `root` argument has no effect.
