### Description

Hi, I am new to this framework, but I can't find a place to answer my two questions, so here I am:

**1.** I would like to know if there is an option to overwrite the log. For example, in **Training 1** I run many `wandb.log({"loss": loss, "val_loss": val_loss}, step=epoch_i)`. Then, I want to run a **Training 2** experiment with different hyperparameters, can I overwrite the log under the same run name? I don't want to _append_, I want to _reset_ the **Training 1** log.

**2.** When using `wandb.log` function, can I already redirect some logs to specific sections to better visualize on the webpage?
