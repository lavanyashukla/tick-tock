### Current Behavior

I am starting a hyperparameter sweep as per the instructions in the quickstart guides (https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/quickstart) but I am encountering the following error message:

"Run 5xep1tqh errored: TypeError('train() takes from 0 to 1 positional arguments but 12 were given')."

It looks like even though I am passing the config object, it is reading 12 different arguments. Possibly, could it be unpacking the config somehow? Strangely enough, my code worked yesterday and I haven't changed anything (as far as I can tell). Any suggestions would be appreciated.
