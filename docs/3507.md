TITLE:
[Q] Possibility to archive projects or dumb data

BODY:
For a project, I have used the Weights & Biases logging library. Over time, I have logged a couple thousand experiments. Because this clogs my W&B disk space, I wanted to know if there's a way to either a) archive the data, or b) download a dump that can (somehow) be viewed offline.

Of the second solution, I am not sure how to achieve this, maybe some kind of lean W&B only for viewing dumps? With that in mind, I am generally looking for a solution that lets me access and also nicely view the data at a later point (around two years).

Downloading the project via wget or curl does not seem to be the right solution; the dynamic dashboards are what makes `wandb` so unique and outstanding.
