Hello,

I have an ongoing run whose state is reported as "crashed" in wandb interface. However, I checked my terminal and the script is still running fine. The "crashed" state appeared 2h10m after the launch of the script and the script is still running at the moment I am posting this message. It is expected to last around 37 hours. Should I stop the execution and relaunch the script? Or is there a way to manually edit the logged values in the wandb interface once the running is finished?
