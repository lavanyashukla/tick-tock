TITLE:
[Q] Accessing the command that was used to run an experiment

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Is it available through the runs api?
It does appear in the UI, so it should be stored somewhere, but how can we access it?

I want to have something like:
```
import wandb
api = wandb.Api()
runs = api.runs("@@")
cmd = runs[0].command
```
