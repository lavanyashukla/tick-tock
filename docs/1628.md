TITLE:
CLI: Feature to import metrics from a previous training run directly instead of creating a training run to upload the data

**Problem or Use Case**
There are times where I would like to visualize and save my training results on wandb that were created without using wandb. However, the only possible way currently is to create a "fake" run and load the table in a for-loop. 

**Suggested Solution**
Add a feature where we can load an external file or dataframe (e.g. csv, JSON, pandas.DataFrame) to wandb directly. Below is a pseudo-code: 

```
import wandb

file_name = '/path/to/csv_file.csv'
wandb.init()
wandb.load_training_results(file_name, type='csv')
```

**Alternatives**
Currently, the only way to do this is by creating a "fake" run and logging the data in a for-loop. This maybe what the new feature might do, but it would be great if there is a function that will do it for us.
