TITLE:
wandb login shouldn't say Not Authenticated!

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
Not Authenticated message seems to confuse users.  Especially since if you run wandb login when you just authenticated it says Not Authenticated again and there's not really clear confirmation after you enter your API key.
