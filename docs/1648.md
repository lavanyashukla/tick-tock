**Describe the bug**

From [docs](https://docs.wandb.ai/library/environment-variables) we can see:

> WANDB_DISABLE_CODE
> Set this to true to prevent wandb from storing a reference to your source code

I add the flag and commitid disappear from run overview. But I still can see commit information on actions button.

**To Reproduce**

1. Go to 'run overview'
2. Click on button in upper-right corner
3. Select 'View code'
4. Select 'You can find your commit here on GitHub.'

**Expected behavior**
Send no information about source code to wandb cloud after the flag is setting.

**Operating System**
 - Linux
 - Firefox

**Additional context**
wandb, version 0.10.12
