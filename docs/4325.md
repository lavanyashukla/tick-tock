[App]: "Duration" field incorrect when resuming runs

### Current Behavior

When restarting a run (using its run ID), the "Duration" indicated in the web app is not correct. It seems to show how long the run was trained after the last time it was resumed, as opposed to the total duration of the run.

### Expected Behavior

I would expect the duration shown to be the total run time. Otherwise a run ongoing for 10 days, then resumed for a few hours, will appear as if it only ran for a few hours in total. This is very confusing!

### Screenshots

Here are two screenshots from the same training run.

It was trained in total for 76h+:

However the "Duration" field appears to be much shorter:
