TITLE:
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: Error 1406: Data too long for column 'group_name' at row 1 (<Response [500]>)

LABEL:
c:misc

STATE:
closed

BODY:
It seems like there's a limit on the group name length. Length 152 works, Length 162 gets the above error message (Didn't try to serach the exact number where it fails)

If it's possible to extend the limit that would be great. Otherwise, would be nice to have a more informative error message.

Thanks.
