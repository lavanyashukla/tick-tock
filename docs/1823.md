[Q] Suppress Run summary and history in Jupyter notebook?

Hello wandb team!

I'm using `wandb` together ðŸ¤—  `transformers` and when I use the latter's hyperparameter search I get a lot of meta info from `wandb` about each trial:

![Screen Shot 2021-02-09 at 6 34 06 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26859204/107404006-1585d400-6b06-11eb-846a-77e064648329.png)

I also get this information whenever I call `wandb.finish()` after a run.

My question is: is there a way to suppress this output from `wandb`? I don't really need all these details cluttering up my Jupyter notebook so it would be great if there is a setting to remove them.

I've tried executing this snippet in a separate cell

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("wandb")
logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
```

but this still produces the run summaries.

Thanks!
