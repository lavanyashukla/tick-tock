TITLE:
[Feature]: Allow to collapse runs in workspace completely

LABEL:

### Description

On the workspace of a project, I cannot completely collapse the sidebar showing the runs. Sometimes this sidebar takes up too much space, that I would rather use to display the plots/metrics. 

Additionally, If I cannot display the full run name by just making it smaller, I might as well just collapse the whole thing. It would be much cleaner that way in my opinion. The legends in the plots can be used for information anyway. This would also improve browsing from mobile I think. It should be a fairly small change with quite a lot of impact (at least from my perspective) on usability.

### Suggested Solution

Similar to the "Expand (ctrl + J)" button, there should be a collapse button that hides the sidebar completely. Of course there should be a button to open it up again once collapsed.
