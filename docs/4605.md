How to solve this problemï¼Ÿ
Actually, I run cmd "wandb agent faircdr/QB-0.3_pretrain_source_MF/z7l6dctz", but it reports bugs:
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: run not found for history loading: faircdr/QB-0.3_pretrain_source_MF/ozgxrdtm (<Response [500]>)
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: run not found for history loading: faircdr/QB-0.3_pretrain_source_MF/x12013z9 (<Response [500]>)
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: run not found for history loading: faircdr/QB-0.3_pretrain_source_MF/x12013z9 (<Response [500]>)
wandb: ERROR Error while calling W&B API: run not found for history loading: faircdr/QB-0.3_pretrain_source_MF/ozgxrdtm (<Response [500]>)
The run ids appeared in reports are my run ids in the previous program, but why it dose not execute new run id, i.e., z7l6dctz?
BTW, I have renamed previous program name (old name is QB-0.3_pretrain_source_MF, new name is QB-0.3_pretrain_target_MF) in the website and  current program name that I want to run is the same as old name of previous program.
Help, please!!!
