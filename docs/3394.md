TITLE:
[App]: New bell icon overlaps with plot

LABEL:
app

STATE:
closed

BODY:
### Current Behavior

I think the new bell icon has been moved from beside name to beside the last **pinned** column. This creates a bit problem if we have multiple pinned columns. Then, the bell icon overlaps with the existing plot hence it's difficult to understand if it's actually running or not.

### Expected Behavior

I think the previous position of the bell icon was very nice.
